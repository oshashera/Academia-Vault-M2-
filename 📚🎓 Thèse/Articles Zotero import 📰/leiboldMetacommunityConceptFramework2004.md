# The metacommunity concept: a framework  for multi-scale community ecology

 “definition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species.”

 “four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view”

 “Remarkably, however, much of formal community theory is focused on a single scale, assuming that local communities are closed and isolated. Within these local communities, populations are assumed to interact directly by affecting each other’s birth and death rates,”

 “other ecological processes involving species interactions occur at other scales”

 “Metacommunity theory describes processes that occur at the metacommunity scale and suggests novel ways of thinking about species interactions.”

 “easy to define local communities wherein species interact by affecting each other’s demographic rates and a metacommunity as a set of local communities that exchange colonists of multiple species”

 “At the regional level, dispersal among local communities occurs and can occur with variable rates. When dispersal rates are low, the primary effects will involve colonization events that can regulate the assembly history of local communities”

 “If dispersal rates are high, we can also investigate the roles of mass effects (Shmida & Wilson 1985) and rescue effects (Brown & Kodric-Brown 1977). These mass and rescue effects modify both species abundance (e.g. sourcesink dynamics; Pulliam 1988) and species interactions (Holt 1985; Danielson 1991), and consequently both could affect community structure and dynamics”

 “own terminology (a guide is presented in Table 1)”

 “In this paper, we restrict ourselves only to metacommunity definitions that consider space implicitly and not explicitly (e.g. spatially explicit models where the location of individuals is tracked). We recognize, however, that there are some important phenomena that depend on spatially determined dynamics that our approach will consequently overlook.”

 “Population All individuals of a single species within a habitat patch”

 “Metapopulation A set of local populations of a single species that are linked by dispersal (after Gilpin and Hanski 1991)”

 “Community The individuals of all species that potentially interact within a single patch or local area of habitat”

 “Metacommunity A set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple interacting species (Wilson 1992)”

 “Patch A discrete area of habitat.”

 “Microsite A site that is capable of holding a single individual. Microsites are nested within localities”

 “Locality An area of habitat encompassing multiple microsites and capable of holding a local community”

 “Mass effect A mechanisms for spatial dynamics in which there is net flow of individuals created by differences in population size (or density) in different patches (Shmida & Wilson 1985)”

 “Rescue effect A mechanism for spatial dynamics in which there is the prevention of local extinction of species by immigration (Brown & Kodric-Brown 1977)”

 “Source–sink effects A mechanism for spatial dynamics in which there is the enhancement of local populations by immigration in ÔsinkÕ localities due to migration of individuals from other localities where emigration results in lowered populations”

 “Colonization A mechanism for spatial dynamics in which populations become established at sites from which they were previously absent”

 “Stochastic extinctions A mechanism whereby established local populations of component species become extinct for reasons that are independent of the other species present or of deterministic change in patch quality. Among other possibilities these include stochastic components associated with small populations and extinctions due to stochastic environmental changes (i.e. disturbances) that can affect large populations”

 “Deterministic extinctions A mechanism whereby established local populations of component species become extinct due to deterministic aspects of patch quality or in the composition of the local community”

 “A system with habitat-specific demography such that some patches (source habitats) have a finite growth rate of greater than unity and produce a net excess of individuals which migrate to sink patches. Populations in sink habitats have finite growth rates of less than one and would decline to extinction in the absence of immigration from sources”

 “local communities do not always have discrete boundaries and that different species may respond to processes at different scales”

 “Patch dynamics perspective A perspective that assumes that patches are identical and that each patch is capable of containing populations. Patches may be occupied or unoccupied. Local species diversity is limited by dispersal. Spatial dynamics are dominated by local extinction and colonization”

([Leibold et al., 2004, p. 604](zotero://select/library/items/7CW9LGUK)) species sorting paradigm = colonization-extinction paradigm je crois

 “Species-sorting perspective A perspective that emphasizes the resource gradients or patch types cause sufficiently strong differences in the local demography of species and the outcomes of local speciesÕ interactions that patch quality and dispersal jointly affect local community composition. This perspective emphasizes spatial niche separation above and beyond spatial dynamics. Dispersal is important because it allows compositional changes to track changes in local environmental conditions”

 “Mass-effect perspective A perspective that focuses on the effect of immigration and emigration on local population dynamics. In such a system species can be rescued from local competitive exclusion in communities where they are bad competitors, by immigrate from communities where they are good competitors. This perspective emphasizes the role that spatial dynamics affect local population densities”

 “Neutral perspective A perspective in which all species are similar in their competitive ability, movement and fitness (Hubbell 2001). Population interactions among species consist of random walks that alter relative frequencies of species. The dynamics of species diversity are then derived both from probabilities of species loss (extinction, emigration) and gain (immigration, speciation).”

 “To date, theoretical and empirical work on metacommunities falls along four broad lines or approaches that we refer to as the Ôpatch-dynamicÕ, Ôspecies-sortingÕ, Ômass-effectÕ and ÔneutralÕ paradigms”

 “The patch-dynamic paradigm”

 “assumes that there are multiple identical patches that undergo both stochastic and deterministic extinctions that can be affected by interspecific interactions, and that are counteracted by dispersal.”

 “Adding predators that are capable of causing local extinction of prey leads to constraints on the dispersal rates at which regional persistence is possible. Prey must colonize patches faster than they are driven extinct and more rapidly than predators, and persistence is only possible at intermediate dispersal rates”

 “The species-sorting paradigm”

 “The second approach builds on theories of community change over environmental gradients (see Whittaker 1962) and considers the effects of local abiotic features on population vital rates and species interactions”

 “In this perspective, local patches are viewed as heterogeneous in some factors and the outcome of local species interactions depends on aspects of the abiotic environment. If different species can only inhabit exclusive habitat types, the resulting metacommunity can be broken down into two independent ones, but when individual species can inhabit multiple habitat types, there are a variety of outcomes that reflect how species interact at larger spatial scales”

 “Populations are assumed to go to their equilibrium behaviour”

 “in between colonization events and before environmental perturbations that might cause extinctions”

 “focuses on trade-offs among species that allow them to specialize on different patch types (local conditions) rather than on possible trade-offs between such traits and dispersal (as is found in the competitioncolonization trade-off commonly found in patch dynamics models)”

 “species-sorting perspective has much in common with traditional theory about niche separation and coexistence”

 “species distributions are closely linked to local conditions and largely independent of unrelated purely spatial effects”

 “Nevertheless, species sorting can still result in complex dynamics because of the possibility of cyclical assembly dynamics that are habitat-specific”

 “One case that comes up in food web models is when a species from a low trophic level serves to assemble a food chain that is dependent on it and is excluded by competition with a competitor that has no resident consumers. The new basal species can then serve to assemble its own food chain that may be reciprocally invaded and excluded by the first species. Such food web assembly cycles”

 “The mass-effects paradigm”

 “While the patch-dynamics and species-sorting paradigms presume that there is a separation of time scales between local dynamics and colonization-extinction dynamics, important regional dynamics may also emerge when this is not so, and local population dynamics are quantitatively affected by dispersal. Such mass effects due to dispersal require that different patches have different conditions at a given time and be sufficiently connected that dispersal can result in source–sink relations between populations in different patches,”

 “The role of dispersal is twofold. Immigration can supplement local birth rates to enhance densities of local populations beyond what might be expected in closed communities and second, and emigration can enhance the loss rates of local populations from that expected in closed communities”

 “hough coexisting species have to differ in their abilities to compete in a particular patch type, they have to have compensating differences in their abilities to compete and disperse to other patch types that make them similar at the regional scale”

 “Coexistence in such a metacommunity is obtained through a regional compensation of local competitive abilities: as a consequence, species are locally different but regionally similar”

 “Mass effects allowing for local coexistence however are constrained in complex ways (Amarasekare & Nisbet 2001) because coexistence requires spatial variance in fitness (competitive ability) but cannot occur if there is too much dispersal among patch types.”

 “At very high dispersal rates, however, mass effects can reduce coexistence in the regional metacommunity with consequent parallel reduction of local diversity as the local communities become homogenized”

 “The neutral paradigm”

 “All the previous approaches presume that species differ from each other in either their niche relations with local factors and/or in their abilities to disperse or avoid local extinctions”

 “In the absence of any such differences among species, the behaviour of metacommunities can be different”

 “this ÔneutralÕ view can be regarded as a null hypothesis for the other three views described above (Bell 2001), but it may also describe dynamics of some communities where species are close to being equivalent or where transient dynamics are very long”

 “In the absence of speciation or of immigration from outside a metacommunity, a neutral model will eventually lead to loss of all competing species but one via a slow process of random walks to extinction”

 “Hubbell (2001) has explored the model in situations where speciation acts to counteract the extinction process and points out that even slow speciation rates can lead to very high sustained levels of diversity in such metacommunities. Under these conditions the neutral model has its own metacommunity dynamics predominantly influenced by slow random patterns of compositional change in space and through time.”

 “THE ROLE OF TRADE-OFFS AMONG SPECIES TRAITS IN METACOMMUNITIES”

 “Clearly all four paradigms outlined above capture interesting aspects of metacommunity dynamics. Further, it is unlikely that all the species that interact in a given set of real metacommunities will uniformly conform to any one of these perspectives. Instead, it is likely that each of these sets of processes will play interactive roles in structuring real metacommunities.”

 “these models differ in the assumptions they make about the ecological traits of species involved in the metacommunity. In the neutral model, the assumption is that there is no variation in these traits, and consequently no covariation either. In the patch-dynamic models for competitive metacommunities the assumption is that there is sufficient variation in competitive ability, and that covariance with dispersal is sufficiently negative to permit regional coexistence. In the mass-effect and species-sorting models, the assumptions are that there are trade-offs in the abilities of species to perform well under different habitat conditions. These considerations lead to the idea that a synthesis of mass-effect and species-sorting perspectives is probably most easily done, and indeed such synthesis has already been suggested”

 “THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE METACOMMUNITY CONCEPT IN ECOLOGY”

 “metacommunity perspective shows that sorting along gradients in communities might result in just the reverse pattern, i.e. locally coexisting species should be more similar than random draws”

 “This prediction results from the fact that combinations of species that are more similar in resource use are less invasible by new species, and these combinations are therefore more likely to persist in the face of colonization.”

 “The complication is that as coexisting species become more similar the dynamic stability of the system decreases”

 “Ultimately the diversity of the local prey assemblages can become saturated but the diversity where this occurs is arbitrary depending on the distribution of prey and predator traits”

 “and will be greater when the regional species pool is large, thus facilitating more diverse local combinations of predators and prey. At the regional level diverse predators and prey assemblages allow more heterogeneity in the eventual compositions of local sites, thus also favouring high regional diversity.”

 “metacommunity dynamics can substantially alter our expectations based solely on a local perspective. For example, in closed local communities, enhanced diversity is likely to lead to decreased stability of local communities and, potentially, of the ecosystems in which they occur (May 1973; Pimm & Lawton 1978). However, dispersal among different local communities from a metacommunity with higher regional biodiversity might stabilize these local dynamics (Mouquet et al. 2002).”
