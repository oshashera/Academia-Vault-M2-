 “All four models predict that habitat fragmentation can, under some conditions, increase the extinction threshold such that, in more fragmented landscapes, more habitat is required for population persistence.”

 “empirical studies have shown both positive and negative effects of habitat fragmentation on population abundance and distribution with about equal frequency”

 “If fragmentation can have a large effect on the extinction threshold, then alteration of habitat pattern (independent of habitat amount) can be an effective tool for conservation. On the other hand, if the effects of fragmentation on the extinction threshold are small, then this is a limited option.”

 “In the CE models, the threshold occurs by an assumed reduction in colonization rate with decreasing habitat amount.”

 “In the BIDE models, loss of habitat is assumed to increase the proportion of the population that spends time in the matrix, where reproduction is not possible and the mortality rate is assumed to be higher (than in breeding habitat).”

 “empirical studies of the independent effects of habitat loss and fragmentation suggest that habitat loss has a much larger effect than habitat fragmentation on the distribution and abundance of birds”

 “Destruction of habitat in a landscape results in loss of populations of organisms that depend on that habitat.”

 “Different species disappear at different points on the habitat loss gradient”

 “and the ‘‘extinction threshold’’ is the minimum amount of habitat required for a population of a particular species to persist in a landscape”

 “The extinction threshold occurs at the amount of habitat at which mortality balances reproduction over”

 “the landscape.”

 “Models predict that habitat fragmentation can increase the extinction threshold such that more habitat is needed for population persistence in more fragmented landscapes”

 “Here, habitat ‘‘fragmentation’’ is literally the ‘‘breaking apart’’ of habitat. As such, it is an element of the pattern of habitat that is independent of the amount of habitat”

 “suggesting that when dispersal is spatially constrained, more habitat is required for population persistence”

 “we do not have empirical information on equilibrium or long-term responses”

 “In the CE models, the extinction threshold is caused by a decrease in cell colonization rate with decreasing habitat amount. Loss of habitat results in loss of source cells, which reduces the rate of colonization”

 “In these models, cell extinction rate is independent of habitat loss”

 “In the BIDE models, loss of habitat increases the probability that individuals enter and spend time in nonbreeding habitat (or ‘‘matrix’’) areas, where reproduction is not possible and mortality rate is assumed to be higher. This decreases the overall reproduction rate and increases the overall mortality rate on the landscape. This reduces the overall population size, which indirectly causes a decrease in the rate of cell immigration. Reduced immigration reduces the rescue effect and the colonization rate. The local extinction rate is also higher due to an increased emigration rate (caused by higher edge:interior ratios; see Bevers and Flather 1999), and the lack of a rescue effect. Habitat loss therefore causes both an increase in the local extinction rate and a decrease in the colonization rate.”

 “the predicted effect of fragmentation is an increase in the extinction threshold; i.e., the models predict that populations in more fragmented landscapes require more habitat for persistence.”

 “In the BIDE models, increasing habitat fragmentation increases the amount of edge on the landscape. This increases the probability of individuals leaving habitat and entering the hostile matrix, where the death rate is higher.”

 “does not imply that fragmentation effects in nature must be negative”

 “Positive edge effects or higher survival of individuals in matrix than in breeding habitat could result in a decrease in the extinction threshold with increasing fragmentation. Positive effects of fragmentation on abundance or distribution have, in fact, been found for several species of forest breeding birds”

 “predict an increasing effect of fragmentation on population size (Flather and Bevers 2001), cell occupancy (Hill and Caswell 1999, With and King 1999), or population persistence time (Fahrig 1997, 1998, 2001), with decreasing habitat amount.”

 “McGarigal and McComb (1995)”

 “they found that habitat area had a much greater effect than habitat fragmentation. In addition, most significant fragmentation effects were positive; that is, species abundances increased with increasing fragmentation.”

 “Meyer et al. (1998)”

 “found that the main influences of landscape structure were related to the amount of habitat, not habitat configuration”

 “Trzcinski et al. (1999)”

 “found that the effects of forest amount far outweighed the effects of forest fragmentation. All 31 coefficients for habitat amount were positive (26 statistically significant), whereas the coefficients for fragmentation were about equally divided between negative and positive, and only six were statistically significant (four negative, two positive)”

 “Villard et al. (1999) found the largest effect of fragmentation relative to amount of habitat of the empirical studies to date.”

 “The empirical studies therefore appear mainly to support the notion that alterations in habitat configuration are likely to have only a small effect on the extinction threshold”

 “However, there are two caveats to this conclusion”

 “it appears that fragmentation effects are at least as likely to be positive as negative.”

 “It seems likely that positive edge effects are a factor.”

 “Kremsater and Bunnell (1999) found that many species do show positive edge effects.”

 “fragmentation increases the amount of edge in the landscape, positive edge effects could be responsible for positive effects of fragmentation on abundance or distribution.”

 “The second caveat is that”

 “all of the empirical studies of which I am aware”

 “have been conducted on birds”

 “factors other than fragmentation affect the extinction threshold.”

 “reproductive output has the largest effect on the extinction threshold.”

 “This result suggests that conservation approaches that focus on improving population performance through improvements during the most critical life history stages for reproductive success and mortality have the potential to decrease the extinction threshold”

 “simulations (Fahrig 2001) suggest that improvements in matrix quality can have a substantial effect on the extinction threshold. If matrix mortality is decreased from near 1 to near 0, by removing sources of very high mortality such as roads or pesticides, the model suggests that the extinction threshold can shift down by up to ;60%”

 “conservation efforts should include consideration of the quality of the whole landscape.”

 “The role of matrix quality in population declines will go undetected if only the quality and pattern of the preferred habitat are considered”
