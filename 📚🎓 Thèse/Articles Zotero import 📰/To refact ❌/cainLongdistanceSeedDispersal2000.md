 “we review existing data and models of long-distance seed dispersal, focusing on situations in which seeds that travel long distances have a critical impact (colonization of islands”

 “The patchy nature of the landscape ensures that the populations of many plant species are spatially isolated from each other, often by hundreds of metres or more. For such species, seed dispersal represents the only way that populations can exchange individuals or colonize empty, but suitable habitat.”

 “most seeds move short distances”

 “while seeming to move little, plants possessed the means to establish new colonies at great distances from their birthplace”

 “ndeed, because long-distance seed dispersal is very difficult to document directly, few even try to do so.”

 “more effort needs to be directed toward quantifying long-distance seed dispersal, the so-called ‘‘tail’’ of the dispersal curve”

 “For the purposes of this paper, we consider a seed dispersal event to be of ‘‘long distance’’ if it is over 100 m”

 “a long-distance seed dispersal event is one that occurs in the upper 1% of seed dispersal distances calculated from an empirically estimated dispersal density function or kernel (see Turchin, 1998).”

 “We discuss the importance of long-distance seed dispersal to metapopulation dynamics in the following section”

 “There are numerous ways that long-distance seed dispersal can occur”

 “These include vertebrate dispersal (by adhesion or ingestion), wind dispersal of seeds (in updrafts and storms, or by secondary dispersal over the substrate), wind dispersal of plants (tumble-plant dispersal), and water dispersal.”

 “For several of these categories, long-distance dispersal can occur accidentally, as when seeds stick to the feet of vertebrates (Darwin, 1859), are ingested by foliage-feeding herbivores (Janzen, 1984), or are consumed and later released by a carnivore when it feeds upon an animal that ate fruit or seeds (Nogales, Delgado, and Medina, 1998). Deliberate or accidental transport by people also can be an important mode of long-distance seed dispersal”

 “Maximum seed dispersal distances on the order of 1–20 km have been recorded for a substantial number of plant species (Sauer, 1988; Cheplick, 1998; Nathan, 2000). Examples of even longer seed dispersal distances are cited in the subsection below, Colonization of islands.”

 “In the past few years, models have been developed that focus on the role of long-distance dispersal in metapopulation dynamics, Holocene migrations, genetic differentiation of populations, biological invasions, global warming, habitat fragmentation, and competitive co-existence”

 “Similarly, Dyer (1995) demonstrates the importance of long-distance dispersal in the context of projected climate change,”

 “many models that incorporate long-distance dispersal describe movement as a stratified process. In a stratified movement model, there are at least two different modes of dispersal, including one that leads to local, short-distance dispersal and one that leads to long-distance dispersal; this is an intuitive approach since seeds often are dispersed by more than one mechanism.”

 “The metapopulation concept has emerged as a dominant paradigm for the description of natural populations”

 “we define metapopulations broadly as a set of spatially disjunct populations linked by dispersal. Spatially disjunct populations of plants are often separated from each other by many hundreds of metres, while most plant seeds disperse far less than 100 m.”

 “we know that long-distance dispersal is important in plant metapopulations”

 “Examples where long-distance seed dispersal is not only important, but essential, include species that lack dormancy and whose habitat either degrades in a predictable fashion (Valverde and Silvertown, 1997) or is subject to catastrophic forms of disturbance (Menges, 1990). For such species, long-distance seed dispersal is the mechanism by which suitable habitat is colonized, thereby enabling the metapopulation to persist despite the fact that individual populations are doomed.”

 “it is common to know little about either of the two ways that plants can come to occupy empty but suitable habitat: dispersal through space (long-distance seed dispersal) and dispersal through time (dormancy).”

 “Metapopulation models are increasingly used to examine both single species and community dynamics”

 “To some degree, all metapopulation models are spatial, in that they are concerned with the dynamics of populations (patches) assumed to be spatially isolated from one another. But space is an implicit variable in many metapopulation models in that no attention is paid to the spatial arrangement of populations”

 “Such models assume that dispersal is equally likely among all populations. In some instances, this assumption may be realistic at intermediate spatial scales”

 “but in general it is not realistic at either small or large spatial scales”

 “However constructed, spatially explicit models of metapopulation dynamics typically suffer from poor information on dispersal.”

 “n many cases, what matters most is the joint dispersal and establishment of seeds, not the movement of seeds to locations in which they cannot establish. In other cases, however, it is clearly important to understand dispersal per se, as well as any factors that might cause an effective dispersal curve to differ from the actual dispersal curve.”

 “A disadvantage common to long-term estimates of dispersal is that historical rates of dispersal may differ from current rates of dispersal. For example, increasing habitat fragmentation might reduce the ability of a species to disperse long distances, thus causing historical estimates of dispersal to overestimate the current tail of a dispersal curve.”

 “A further complicating factor is that the ability of plants to disperse long distances can be expected to change over time. Seed dispersal events take place within complex natural landscapes. As those landscapes are fragmented over time, the ability of seeds to move long distances may be reduced.”

 “in the following section we discuss how several promising approaches can be used to estimate the frequency with which seeds travel long distances.”

 “genetic data often do not allow direct characterization of a seed dispersal curve since it is usually seedlings (or later stages) that are sampled, not seeds.”

 “When seeds are not sampled genetically, genetic estimates of seed dispersal reflect both the movement (dispersal per se) and establishment of seeds. In such cases, genetic approaches provide an ‘‘effective’’ seed dispersal curve, not the actual seed dispersal curve.”

 “spatially realistic metapopulation models can be used to predict consequences of habitat fragmentation for the persistence of species. Predictions of spatially realistic models depend critically on how dispersal is modeled; thus it is imperative to collect data on the tail of dispersal curves and use them to examine metapopulation persistence. Similarly, an urgent question is whether plant species can migrate rapidly enough to keep up with projected global climate change.”
