 “different authors measuring fragmentation in different ways and, as a consequence, drawing different conclusions regarding both the magnitude and direction of its effects”

 “Habitat fragmentation is usually defined as a landscape-scale process involving both habitat loss and the breaking apart of habitat.”

 “many researchers measure fragmentation at the patch scale, not the landscape scale and (b) most researchers measure fragmentation in ways that do not distinguish between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se, i.e., the breaking apart of habitat after controlling for habitat loss.”

 “habitat loss has large, consistently negative effects on biodiversity”

 “Habitat fragmentation per se has much weaker effects on biodiversity that are at least as likely to be positive as negative”

 “Habitat fragmentation is often defined as a process during which “a large expanse of habitat is transformed into a number of smaller patches of smaller total area, isolated from each other by a matrix of habitats unlike the original””

 “his approach conforms to the definition of fragmentation as a process, it has two inherent weaknesses. First, because habitat fragmentation is a landscapescale process (McGarigal & Cushman 2002), the sample size in such studies, for questions about the effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity, is typically”

 “only two, i.e., one continuous landscape and one fragmented landscape. With such a design, inferences about the effects of fragmentation are weak.”

 “Second, this characterization of habitat fragmentation is strictly qualitative, i.e., each landscape can be in only one of two states, continuous or fragmented. This design does not permit one to study the relationship between the degree of habitat fragmentation and the magnitude of the biodiversity response”

 “Fragmentation as Pattern: Quantitative Conceptualizations”

 “The definition of habitat fragmentation above implies four effects of the process of fragmentation on habitat pattern:”

 “(a) reduction in habitat amount, (b) increase in number of habitat patches, (c) decrease in sizes of habitat patches, and (d) increase in isolation of patches.”

 “fragmentation measures vary widely; some include only one effect (e.g., reduced habitat amount or reduced patch sizes), whereas others include two or three effects but not all four”

 “Does it matter which fragmentation measure a researcher uses? The answer depends on whether the different effects of the process of fragmentation on habitat pattern have the same effects on biodiversity.”

 “the different effects of the process of fragmentation on habitat pattern do not affect biodiversity in the same way. This has led to apparently contradictory conclusions about the effects of fragmentation on biodiversity.”

 “FRAGMENTATION AS HABITAT LOSS”

 “The most obvious effect of the process of fragmentation is the removal of habitat (Figure 1).”

 “If we can measure the level of fragmentation as the amount of habitat, why do we call it “fragmentation”? Why not simply call it habitat loss?”

 “the word invokes more than habitat removal: “fragmentation . . . not only causes loss of the amount of habitat, but by creating small, isolated patches it also changes the properties of the remaining habitat” (van den Berg et al. 2001).”

 “Habitat can be removed from a landscape in many different ways, resulting in many different spatial patterns (Figure 2). Do some patterns represent a higher degree of fragmentation than others, and does this have implications for biodiversity? If the answer to either of these questions is “no,” then the concept of fragmentation is redundant with habitat loss.”

 “FRAGMENTATION AS A CHANGE IN HABITAT CONFIGURATION”

 “Most researchers do not separate the effects of habitat loss from the configurational effects of fragmentation. This leads to ambiguous conclusions regarding the effects of habitat configuration on biodiversity”

 “It is also common for fragmentation studies to report individual effects of fragmentation measures without reporting the relationships among them, which again makes the results difficult to interpret”

 “THE PATCH-SCALE PROBLEM”

 “problems arise when fragmentation is measured at the patch scale rather than the landscape scale. Because fragmentation is a landscape-scale process (Figure 1), fragmentation measurements are correctly made at the landscape scale”

 “Patch size: an ambiguous measure of fragmentation”

 “Using patch size as a measure of habitat fragmentation per se implicitly assumes that patch size is independent of habitat amount at the landscape scale (e.g., Niemel ̈a 2001). However, regions where patches are large often correspond to regions where there is more habitat”

 “Patch isolation: a measure of habitat amount”

 “patch isolation is almost universally interpreted as a measure of habitat configuration. However, patch isolation is more accurately viewed as a measure of the lack of habitat in the landscape surrounding the patch.”

 “The more isolated a patch is, generally speaking, the less habitat there is in the landscape that surrounds it (Figure 7). Therefore, when translated to the landscape scale, isolation of a patch is a measure of habitat amount in the landscape, not configuration of the landscape.”

 “Bender et al. (2003) reviewed measures of patch isolation. All measures are strongly negatively related to habitat amount in the surrounding landscape.”

 “Patches with small nearest-neighbor distances are typically situated in landscapes containing more habitat than are patches with large nearest-neighbor distances (Figure 7), so in most situations this measure of isolation is related to habitat amount in the landscape”

 “MEASURING HABITAT FRAGMENTATION PER SE”

 “EFFECTS OF HABITAT FRAGMENTATION ON BIODIVERSITY In this section I review the empirical evidence for effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity”

 “The fragmentation literature can be distilled into two major effects: the generally strong negative effect of habitat loss on biodiversity, and the much weaker, positive or negative effect of fragmentation per se on biodiversity”

 “Because the effect of fragmentation per se is weaker than the effect of habitat loss, to detect the effect of fragmentation per se, the effect of habitat loss must be experimentally or statistically controlled”

 “Effects of Habitat Loss on Biodiversity”

 “Habitat loss has large, consistently negative effects on biodiversity, so researchers who conceptualize and measure fragmentation as equivalent to habitat loss typically conclude that fragmentation has large negative effects.”

 “negative effects of habitat loss apply not only to direct measures of biodiversity such as species richness”

 “population abundance and distribution”

 “and genetic diversity”

 “but also to indirect measures of biodiversity and factors affecting biodiversity.”

 “predicts a negative effect of habitat loss on population growth rate”

 “species showing declining trends in global abundance are more likely to occur in areas with high habitat loss than are species with increasing or stable trends”

 “Habitat loss has been shown to reduce trophic chain length”

 “to alter species interactions”

 “and to reduce the number of specialist, large-bodied species”

 “Habitat loss also negatively affects breeding success”

 “dispersal success”

 “predation rate”

 “and aspects of animal behavior that affect foraging success rate”

 “Patch isolation effects Patch isolation is a measure of the lack of habitat in the landscape surrounding the patch”

 “many studies that have shown negative effects of patch isolation on species richness or presence/absence”

 “strong negative effect of landscape-scale habitat loss on biodiversity”

 “suggests a strong effect of habitat amount on interpatch movement”

 “Patch size effects”

 “Individual species have minimum patch size requirements”

 “Therefore, smaller patches generally contain fewer species than larger patches (Debinski & Holt 2000), and the set of species on smaller patches is often a more-or-less predictable subset of the species on larger patches”

 “the amount of habitat on a landscape required for species occurrence there differs among species”

 “so landscapes with less habitat should contain a subset of the species found in landscapes with more habitat.”

 “landscape-scale interpretation of patch size effects depends on the landscape context of the patch.”

 “found that forest birds had lower reproductive rates in small patches than in large patches. If small patches occur in areas with less forest, the reduced reproductive rate may not be the result of patch size, but may result from larger populations of nest predators and brood parasites that occur in landscapes with more open habitat”

 “EXTINCTION THRESHOLD”

 “The number of individuals of any species that a landscape can support should be a positive function of the amount of habitat available to”

 “that species in the landscape”

 “However, several theoretical studies suggest that the relationship is not proportional; they predict a threshold habitat level below which the population cannot sustain itself, termed the extinction threshold”

 “Theoretical studies suggest that habitat fragmentation per se can affect where the extinction threshold occurs on the habitat amount axis.”

 “However, the occurrence of the extinction threshold is a response to habitat loss, not fragmentation per se.”

 “Effects of Habitat Fragmentation per se on Biodiversity”

 “fragmentation effects per se, i.e., for effects of “breaking apart” of habitat on biodiversity,”

 “recent models predict negative effects of habitat fragmentation per se”

 “empirical evidence to date suggests that the effects of fragmentation per se are generally much weaker than the effects of habitat loss”

 “empirical studies suggest that the effects of fragmentation per se are at least as likely to be positive as negative.”

 “However, the positive effects of fragmentation can not be explained as merely responses by “weedy,” habitat generalist species”

 “THE 20–30% THRESHOLD”

 “Some theoretical studies suggest that the effects of fragmentation per se should become apparent only at low levels of habitat amount, below approximately 20–30% habitat on the landscape”

 “no convincing empirical evidence for this prediction”

 “REASONS FOR NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF FRAGMENTATION PER SE”

 “Negative effects of fragmentation are likely due to two main causes.”

 “First, fragmentation per se implies a larger number of smaller patches. At some point, each patch of habitat will be too small to sustain a local population or perhaps even an individual territory. Species that are unable to cross the nonhabitat portion of the landscape (the “matrix”) will be confined to a large number of too-small patches, ultimately reducing the overall population size and probability of persistence”

 “The second main cause of negative effects of fragmentation per se is negative edge effects; more fragmented landscapes contain more edge for a given amount of habitat. This can increase the probability of individuals leaving the habitat and entering the matrix. Overall the amount of time spent in the matrix will be larger in a more fragmented landscape, which may increase overall mortality rate and reduce overall reproductive rate of the population (Fahrig 2002). In addition, there are negative edge effects due to species interactions. Probably the most extensively studied of these is increased predation on forest birds at forest edges”

 “REASONS FOR POSITIVE EFFECTS OF FRAGMENTATION PER SE”

 “even if fragmentation per se has a positive effect on biodiversity, this effect will be masked by the large negative effect of habitat loss.”

 “hypothesized that habitat subdivision provides temporary refugia for the prey species, where they can increase in numbers and disperse elsewhere before the predator or parasite finds them. The plausibility of this mechanism was supported by early theoretical studies”

 “Early theoretical studies also suggested that habitat fragmentation enhances the stability of two-species competition”

 “coexistence of two competing species could be extended by dividing the habitat into more, smaller patches”

 “Enhanced coexistence resulted from a trade-off between dispersal rate and competitive ability. This trade-off, along with asynchronous disturbances that locally removed the superior competitor, allowed the inferior competitor (but superior disperser) to colonize the empty patches first, before being later displaced by the superior competitor (Chesson 1985)”

 “Other researchers suggested that habitat subdivision could even stabilize single-species population dynamics when local disturbances are asynchronous by reducing the probability of simultaneous extinction of the whole population”

 “the predicted positive effects of fragmentation per se depend strongly on particular assumptions about the relative movement rates of predator versus prey (or host versus parasite), the trade-off between competitive ability and movement rate, and the asynchrony of disturbances”

 “habitat amount is held constant, increasing fragmentation per se actually implies smaller distances between patches (Figure 5). Therefore, a positive effect of fragmentation per se could be due to a reduction in patch isolation”

 “many species require more than one kind of habitat”

 “For example, immature insects and amphibians often use different habitats than those they use as adults. A successful life cycle requires that the adults can move away from the habitat where they were reared to their adult habitats and then back to the immature habitat to lay eggs.”

 “The proximity of different required habitat types will determine the ease with which individuals can move among them.”

 “The degree to which landscape structure facilitates movement among different required habitat types was labeled “landscape complementation” by Dunning et al. (1992). For the same amount of habitat, a more fragmented landscape (more, smaller patches, and more edge) will have a higher level of interdigitation of different habitat types. This should increase landscape complementation, which has a positive effect on biodiversity”

 “it seems likely that positive edge effects are a factor. Some species do show positive edge effects”
