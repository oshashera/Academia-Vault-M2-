#  “Context and connectivity in plant metapopulations and landscape mosaics: does the matrix matter?”

 “Separate but related paradigms from the disciplines of landscape ecology and metapopulation ecology exist for understanding patterns of regional population variation. The major models of both paradigms assume a binary landscape mosaic composed of ‘‘suitable habitat’’ and background ‘‘matrix.’’”

 “An important distinction between the two approaches is that metapopulation models essentially ignore features of the matrix. A binary approach to the landscape seems inappropriate for plants for several reasons. First, plants probably do not have a binary perception of the landscape, but rather respond to gradients of resource quality.”

 “Secondly, many plants rely on a range of other agents for dispersal of pollen and seed, all of which are also affected by their environment in terms of connectivity. Furthermore the various components of the mosaic, including physical, spatial and functional elements can significantly influence plant movements.”

 “In theory, metapopulations represent the organisms inhabiting regional landscapes / the reef fishes, grizzly bears, buttercups and butterflies, each experiencing its environment at unique, species-specific scales.”

 “landscape ecology considers a variety of subjects, including population dynamics, however its general goal is often summarized as the effects of landscape structure and spatial configuration on ecological processes”

 “The major theoretical models of both landscape ecology and metapopulation ecology assume a binary landscape, composed of ‘‘habitat’’ and ‘‘matrix’’ (i.e. the non-habitat surrounding native habitat patches,”

 “An important distinction between the metapopulation approach and the spatially-explicit population approach of landscape ecology is that metapopulation models essentially ignore the characteristics of the non-habitat, or matrix portion of the landscape”

 “In contrast, landscape models often assume that movement between patches depends on attributes of the matrix, which may influence dispersal mortality and/or movement direction”

 “At all spatial scales, suitable environments are interspersed in a matrix of more or less inhospitable space (Eriksson and Ehrle ́n 2001).”

 “This means that for most plant species a fragmented habitat is the physical arena within which population dynamics, ecological processes, adaptation and evolution occur.”

 “persistence of plants over the long term requires coping with temporally and spatially unpredictable resources.”

 “Many plant life-history features, including dispersal structures, seed dormancy, seed size and clonal propagation can be interpreted in this context”

 “For example, the existence of long-lived life cycle stages (seeds, vegetative ramets) means that local populations may persist for a long time even though a patch has become unsuitable”

 “In animalpollinated plants, reproductive success may be negatively related to the distance between flowering patches”

 “Furthermore, even when pollinators successfully travel long distances between patches, the quality of the pollen transferred may decline. For example, generalist pollinators may visit a variety of species when travelling longer distances, and heterospecific pollen may clog stigmas and lower reproductive success”

 “For example, suitable habitat may be relatively easily defined for obligate epiphytes growing on tree trunks, or for hemiparasitic mistletoes growing in tree canopies. However for many other species, in particular those having relatively broad limits of physiological tolerance, there is often no clear distinction between habitat and matrix, and defining distinct habitat patches becomes difficult or impossible”

 “Most plants probably respond to gradients of resource quality (With et al. 1997). For these species, suitable habitat lies along some environmental continuum, from optimal habitat, through suitable, and sub-optimal, with many biotic and abiotic parameters contributing toward suitability. Where a species does not perceive sharp and distinct boundaries, patch properties become less important and the nature of the overall landscape mosaic becomes increasingly significant in species’ dynamics”

 “many plants appear not to be arranged as metapopulations”

 “some species appear to exist as metapopulations in the classic sense, where regional persistence is governed by the processes of patch colonization, extinction and recolonization.”

 “However according to Freckleton and Watkinson other species exist as regional ensembles, systems of essentially unconnected local populations persisting in an illdefined mosaic of suitable and unsuitable habitat; while still others exist as spatially extended populations, essentially a single, extended population occupying large tracts of suitable habitat,”

 “The assumption in metapopulation ecology that properties of the matrix are unimportant is probably only really true for terrestrial organisms inhabiting oceanic islands.”

 “One feature that distinguishes terrestrial habitat fragmentation from the true island model (of MacArthur and Wilson 1967) is that the matrix may, for some species, actually be hospitable to varying degrees.”

 “In this case the matrix should have a strong influence on the between-patch processes of dispersal and colonization, as well as the within-patch processes of extinction, population growth and density dependence”

 “The matrix has at least three potential roles in between-patch processes: (1) reducing or enhancing dispersal and colonization rates; (2) providing alternative, though possibly sub-optimal, habitat; and (3) as a source of novel invading species competing for patch space”

 “In principle, the matrix begins at the edge of a patch and is composed of an array of natural and anthropogenically-derived features which tend to act as barriers to, or conduits for, biotic movement”

 “Lidicker (1999) pointed out that difficulties arise due to an unclear definition of corridors, and proposed that corridors should be viewed functionally, as any narrowly delimited place in the environment that facilitates movement of organisms between patches, relative to the matrix.”

 “According to Lidicker, corridors should not be construed as linear strips of habitat independently supporting breeding populations of focal species, and they need not necessarily be of the same habitat quality as the patches they connect”

 “a focus on corridors as the defining element of connectedness in a matrix tends to perpetuate the simplistic patch-matrix view of landscapes and obscures some of the richness of detail that characterises landscape mosaics”

 “‘‘Connectivity’’”

 “is an aggregate property of the structural configuration and composition of elements in a landscape mosaic; it is the relative permeability of their boundaries to species”

 “Connectivity is a functional measure of landscape structure / the degree to which the landscape facilitates or impedes the movement of individuals among patches”

 “Although a boundary, or ecotone, may have properties of its own, the nature of a boundary is largely contextual, determined by the surrounding environment (Wiens 2002a).”

 “‘‘Context’’ determines the rate of immigration into a patch, through (1) the amount of occupied habitat in the area around the patch that is within the dispersal range of the organism; and (2) the quality of the intervening non-habitat area / the matrix / for survival and dispersing individuals (Fahrig 2001)”

 “Habitat proximal to a patch may be more important in determining dispersal rates than habitat farther away, since proximal habitat must be crossed in order to migrate, whereas more distal habitat is less likely to lie within the realised migration route of any particular individual”

 “Thus a further context-related variable having potentially important influences on movement of organisms or propagules is ‘edge context’”

 “Furthermore, the permeability of the edge itself may be just as important as the permeability of the environment between two patches in determining the probability of success of emigration or immigration. Patches may be bounded by an impenetrable boundary that dispersing individuals virtually never cross”

 “Clearly, relevant spatial scale is species specific. Different species perceive a landscape at different scales”

 “Furthermore, the same species might perceive its environment at different scales during different life stages. Plants of most species live parts of their lives at two different spatial scales: the relatively broad, dispersal scale of the seed and pollen grain, and the relatively fine scale of the sessile adult”

 “For adults, day-to-day growth may depend only on immediate microsite conditions,”

 “But reproductive success may depend on processes operating at broader scales”

 “Hence spatial scale is also processspecific.”

 “Despite the fact that terrestrial habitat patches tend to be surrounded by a complex mosaic of other landcover types (Forman 1995), which may differ in their resistance to the movement of individuals among patches, the landscape matrix has mostly been assumed to be uniform, and most connectivity measures in the literature of population ecology are based on simple nearest-neighbour distances (Moilanen and Neiminen 2002), or negative exponential distances with population size or area as weighting functions”

 “In fact, although it is widely held that species having high mobilities are more tolerant of habitat loss and fragmentation (due to the potential for increased colonization rates), the high emigration rates in these species may also increase the overall population mortality rate, by placing such individuals in a perilous matrix more frequently. Therefore, as Fahrig (2001) argued, the concept of dispersal ability may only be applicable in a species’ optimal environment and not necessarily in a human-altered, fragmented landscape”

 “Movement between patches has been mostly thought of in terms of corridors (Tischendorf and Fahrig 2000a), however it is perhaps more usefully envisioned as a complex product of particular patch qualities (e.g. resistance to movement, or patch residence time), boundary properties, and context”

 “Ricketts’s results suggest that the surrounding matrix may significantly influence the effective isolation of habitat patches, rendering them more or less isolated than simple distance would indicate.”

 “For mobile organisms which tend to migrate only short distances between patches, resistance parameters may be relatively straight-forward to calculate and incorporate into metapopulation models.”

 “However measures of the effect of a heterogeneous matrix on migration or dispersal are not so easy to estimate for organisms such as plants / which rely on a variety of other organisms and agents (water, wind), to disperse propagules and gametes between patches”

 “Landscape context, boundary effects and the matrix all importantly influence connectivity and ultimately individual success,”

 “Edge avoidance by mixedspecies bird flocks was also reduced when fragments were surrounded by regrowth rather than cattle pasture”

 “Laurance et al. (2002) point out that several species”

 “recolonized fragments when regrowth regenerated in the surrounding landscape.”

 “In general, the more closely the matrix approximated the structure and microclimate of the primary forests, the more likely that fragmentation-sensitive species could use it”

 “Fahrig (2001) estimated that under certain circumstances up to 58% less habitat was required for population persistence if a matrix of very low quality was converted to one of very high quality.”

 “Holt’s theoretical results suggested that species having high occupancies in the abundant habitat (the matrix) had the potential to contribute disproportionately to species composition in the more sparse habitat (the patches), via a spillover effect.”

 “Forest fragments are susceptible to ‘‘bombardment’’ of propagules from weedy plant species in the matrix vegetation, which may then be incorporated into the fragments community”

 “These studies typically demonstrate that for some species in certain landscape contexts, corridors facilitated movement between patches, but were often not essential. Furthermore, the disparate response of species, even closely related taxa, is noteworthy”

 “Highly mobile species, such as birds and many insects, can move rapidly over extensive areas of fragmented landscapes, and for these species even small remnant patches of habitat may act as ‘stepping stones’ across the landscape and enhance movement”

 “Thus connectivity may be improved between patches without necessity for a continual corridor between patches; rather, remnant habitat between patches may suffice to improve connectivity for relatively mobile species.”

 “For particularly long-lived species,”

 “the traditional definition of the matrix”

 “, habitat suitable for traversing but unsuitable for supporting breeding individuals,”

 “is often not appropriate.”

 “Levin (1995) reviewed the importance in highly modified habitats of isolated trees, or ‘‘reproductive outliers,’’ to within-patch population dynamics. Levin suggested that these trees may serve as bridges between populations and concluded that, although isolated individuals may produce fewer seeds than do individuals located within inhabited patches, they may be a major source for pollen and seeds to nearby populations, retarding the divergence of local populations and forming nuclei for new populations.”

 “Edge effects are closely related to both landscape context and corridor effects on connectivity.”

 “Sisk et al. (1997) suggested that many matrix effects may actually manifest as edge effects.”

 “landscape context should not be expected to have much impact on emigration for patches with relatively hard (impermeable) edges”

 “By disrupting or impeding movement of pollinators, edges having relatively high impermeability may restrict pollen flow and seed dispersal among plants in patches”

 “Edge-mediated effects on seed dispersal and seed mortality may also be important in determining species composition, and successional patterns in patches”

 “In regions of remnant tropical forest surrounded by a harsher, modified environment, edgerelated seed mortality may impede germination of native tree fauna at the expense of more edge-tolerant weedy species, so altering successional patterns and making fragmented forest even less similar to unfragmented forest”

 “In temperate forests, extinction likelihoods may be greater due to decreased population sizes near habitat edges”

 “Edge-related gradients in physical and biotic variables are likely to be less pronounced when the matrix is more similar in structure to that of the fragment”

 “Results showed that both the types of land-use and their proportions at different distances from the edge of each patch of natural area (at 0, 100, 250 and 500 m from the perimeter) had highly significant effects on species richness of biota.”

 “Plant population dynamics are often influenced by more than a patch/matrix model can account for”

 “where suitable habitat patches are not easily delineated, but rather where gradients of habitat suitability more appropriately characterize the region”

 “Here description of the landscape in terms of suitable patches and a homogenous matrix greatly oversimplifies reality”

 “For plants, the distribution of ‘‘safe sites’’ (sensu Harper 1977) for seed germination and seedling recruitment should be very important. Furthermore, populations of pollinators and seed dispersers will likely be necessary; factors associated with pathogens/parasites and competitors will all also likely be important functional variables”

 “The matrix clearly is important in its effect on connectivity and population dynamics of species living in fragmented habitats. However we have argued that, for many plant species, patches of suitable habitat are not readily defined and, furthermore that plants likely respond to gradients of habitat suitability. Thus, by default, the matrix, or unsuitable habitat (as traditionally defined), is also difficult to discern, and nebulous. The advantage of the functional mosaic approach, when combined with division of the landscape into a grid, is that each cell within the grid can be described simply in terms of local population size and its structural and functional context, without the need to define explicitly patch and matrix habitat. In this sense, the answer to the question we pose in the title of this paper is, strictly, no / the matrix is not important, but neither is the patch / rather the nature of the composite landscape mosaic is the key determinant of the fate of plant populations.”

 “A landscape is always heterogeneous at some spatial or temporal scale. Structurally it is a mosaic, with multiple sources, barriers, conduits, attractors, repellents, sinks, avoidance spots, and comfort places (Forman 2002).”

 “From an individual’s perspective, it is a mosaic of food resources, grazing and predation risks, confrontations and competitions, and structural conditions.”
