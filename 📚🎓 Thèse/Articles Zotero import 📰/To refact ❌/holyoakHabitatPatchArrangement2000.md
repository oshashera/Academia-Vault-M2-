[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBYCG4BJ?page=378&annotation=DEFUIBHM) “As predicted by single-species and/or predator-prey metapopulation models, substantial variation in predator metapopulation persistence was accounted for by the amount of patches or habitat, number of dispersal corridors, maximum interpatch distance, and proportion of patches providing colonists (which depends on the explicit spatial arrangement of patches)”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBYCG4BJ?page=378&annotation=JHIVCEGH) “Contrary to expectation, persistence was not influenced by loops of patches or patch similarity.”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBYCG4BJ?page=378&annotation=C357LMET) “Persistence was also shorter in four-patch loops than three-patch loops, indicating an interaction between patch number and arrangement, which is not predicted by published models.”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBYCG4BJ?page=378&annotation=4BI7P9VI) “Spatial synchrony of density fluctuations was central to predator persistence but had complex effects on extinction-colonization dynamics, rescue effects, and predatorprey interaction strength.”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBYCG4BJ?page=378&annotation=XLIVY48T) “metapopulation theory has come from models with many patches”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBYCG4BJ?page=378&annotation=6JNB4R6S) “The spatial arrangement of habitat patches is also relevant to metapopulation persistence because it influences the number of adjacent patches that are sources of colonists, the likelihood of interpatch movement, and the degree of independence of dynamics in patches separated by different distances”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBYCG4BJ?page=378&annotation=DC4EMWPK) “ore considering the effects of habitat patch arrangement, it is useful to consider how the amount of habitat and patch number affect metapopulation persistence. These two factors have separate effects on persistence, although they are frequently confounded”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBYCG4BJ?page=378&annotation=PJ7V5ZID) “A limited amount of habitat can restrict regional population size, which may interact with stochasticity to increase the likelihood of extinction”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBYCG4BJ?page=378&annotation=44B8IPU6) “A limited number of habitat patches can also restrict the potential for metapopulation persistence via a balance between patch extinction and colonization”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBYCG4BJ?page=379&annotation=NAHB2PIB) “or through local populations being rescued from extinction by immigration (“rescue effects””

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBYCG4BJ?page=379&annotation=U44QPMDD) “spatial arrangement of small numbers of habitat patches can influence regional persistence”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBYCG4BJ?page=379&annotation=K9FKUTGE) “regional persistence was prolonged either by selecting patches that were less likely to go extinct simultaneously or by facilitating recolonization.”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBYCG4BJ?page=379&annotation=NWNA5Z7D) “Patch arrangement can also contribute to regional persistence by facilitating recolonization.”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBYCG4BJ?page=379&annotation=N2B36529) “Regional persistence should then be maximized by clusters or loops of patches, which provide more local sources of immigrants”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBYCG4BJ?page=379&annotation=E3S4HFEE) “than linear patch arrangements”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBYCG4BJ?page=379&annotation=JCTA5EGM) “imulations with large numbers of habitat patches show that predators and prey persist longer in systems with more patches (and, hence, more total habitat)”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBYCG4BJ?page=379&annotation=6YUWZ6SH) “persistence is longer when within-patch dynamics are more independent in different patches, providing that recolonization is possible”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBYCG4BJ?page=379&annotation=YUZZAXWU) “At low dispersal rates of both species, predators go extinct from local patches more frequently than they recolonize, causing regional predator extinction.”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBYCG4BJ?page=379&annotation=ZX8QP226) “However, at intermediate dispersal rates, both species may be able to persist through rescue effects and a balance between patch extinction and recolonization”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBYCG4BJ?page=379&annotation=VKYDDWIT) “In patchy habitats, spatial dynamics extended persistence of the predator by an average of over 200 generations compared to the large undivided populations.”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBYCG4BJ?page=379&annotation=LSCPNZX3) “patches farther apart tend to have less correlated dynamics”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBYCG4BJ?page=379&annotation=RWS4EIF6) “patch arrangements that make recolonization more likely should facilitate metapopulation persistence.”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBYCG4BJ?page=383&annotation=3SJ9JMW2) “This is the first experimental demonstration that metapopulation persistence is influenced by the explicit spatial arrangement of patches and corridors, as opposed to nonspatial scaling factors like mean dispersal rate.”

idée perso mais c'est que y a plus de chemin à faire pour recoloniser / rescue dans le 4 pcq y a tjrs un patch pour lequel un autre patch est pas en lien direct ?

ptet que :  
- autant de lien direct (2 tuyaux chaque bouteille) qu'on soit en D ou H  
- H plus de réserve donc plus de colonisation / échanges possibles pour la même connectivité →plus grande peak density?????

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBYCG4BJ?page=384&annotation=XAYW99YE) “both predator and prey dynamics in adjacent patches were more synchronous in H than D;” plus synchro à 4 qu'à 3 ?
