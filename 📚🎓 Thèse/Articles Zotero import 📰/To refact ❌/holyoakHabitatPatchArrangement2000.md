(10/24/2025, 10:51:13 AM)

 “This study tests whether spatial dynamics can stabilize metapopulations with a small number of patches and tests the influence of patch arrangement”

 “As predicted by single-species and/or predator-prey metapopulation models, substantial variation in predator metapopulation persistence was accounted for by the amount of patches or habitat, number of dispersal corridors, maximum interpatch distance, and proportion of patches providing colonists (which depends on the explicit spatial arrangement of patches)”

 “Contrary to expectation, persistence was not influenced by loops of patches or patch similarity.”

 “Persistence was also shorter in four-patch loops than three-patch loops, indicating an interaction between patch number and arrangement, which is not predicted by published models.”

 “Spatial synchrony of density fluctuations was central to predator persistence but had complex effects on extinction-colonization dynamics, rescue effects, and predatorprey interaction strength.”

 “metapopulation theory has come from models with many patches”

 “The spatial arrangement of habitat patches is also relevant to metapopulation persistence because it influences the number of adjacent patches that are sources of colonists, the likelihood of interpatch movement, and the degree of independence of dynamics in patches separated by different distances”

 “before considering the effects of habitat patch arrangement, it is useful to consider how the amount of habitat and patch number affect metapopulation persistence. These two factors have separate effects on persistence, although they are frequently confounded”

 “A limited amount of habitat can restrict regional population size, which may interact with stochasticity to increase the likelihood of extinction”

 “A limited number of habitat patches can also restrict the potential for metapopulation persistence via a balance between patch extinction and colonization”

 “or through local populations being rescued from extinction by immigration (“rescue effects””

 “spatial arrangement of small numbers of habitat patches can influence regional persistence”

 “regional persistence was prolonged either by selecting patches that were less likely to go extinct simultaneously or by facilitating recolonization.”

 “Patch arrangement can also contribute to regional persistence by facilitating recolonization.”

 “Regional persistence should then be maximized by clusters or loops of patches, which provide more local sources of immigrants”

 “than linear patch arrangements”

 “simulations with large numbers of habitat patches show that predators and prey persist longer in systems with more patches (and, hence, more total habitat)”

 “persistence is longer when within-patch dynamics are more independent in different patches, providing that recolonization is possible”

 “At low dispersal rates of both species, predators go extinct from local patches more frequently than they recolonize, causing regional predator extinction.”

 “However, at intermediate dispersal rates, both species may be able to persist through rescue effects and a balance between patch extinction and recolonization”

 “In patchy habitats, spatial dynamics extended persistence of the predator by an average of over 200 generations compared to the large undivided populations.”

 “patches farther apart tend to have less correlated dynamics”

 “patch arrangements that make recolonization more likely should facilitate metapopulation persistence.”

 “The degree of independence of density fluctuations in different bottles (spatial synchrony)”

 “increasing the maximum distance between patches (bottles) extended predator persistence”

 “predator persistence increased with dispersal”

 “Dispersal rate, manipulated by changing the number of tubes per bottle,”

 “regional persistence was longer when habitats were not compartmentalized so that a greater proportion of patches could provide colonists” Compartmentalization indicates whether all patches were directly connected by corridors or not

 “This is the first experimental demonstration that metapopulation persistence is influenced by the explicit spatial arrangement of patches and corridors, as opposed to nonspatial scaling factors like mean dispersal rate.”

 “compartmentalization would alter the length of local extinctions (within individual patches).”

 “Patches connected to a larger proportion of patches within microcosms (lower habitat compartmentalization) were recolonized by predators more quickly” microcosm = arrangement spatial fig 1 → ici c'est les patches avec plus de connections directes si je comprends bien

 “Correlations between spatial synchrony and predator persistence provided evidence for spatial dynamics extending persistence in all microcosms except types A and H, where predator persistence was short”

 “persistence increased with increases in dispersal opportunities until the point where density fluctuations across patches became synchronous”

 “the amount of patches or habitat produced up to 61-d difference in the mean persistence per microcosm type”

 “this was because of two-patch microcosms’ having shorter persistence than three- or four-patch microcosms”

 “microcosms with a strict loop of patches, predators on average persisted for 47 d fewer in microcosms with four (H) patches than with three (D) patches” D > H  
  
idée perso mais c'est que y a plus de chemin à faire pour recoloniser / rescue dans le 4 pcq y a tjrs un patch pour lequel un autre patch est pas en lien direct ?

 “predators had a 47% higher peak density in H than in D” p'tet pcq qtité habitat ↑ ds 4 et que 3   
  
ptet que :  
- autant de lien direct (2 tuyaux chaque bouteille) qu'on soit en D ou H  
- H plus de réserve donc plus de colonisation / échanges possibles pour la même connectivité →plus grande peak density?????

 “both predator and prey dynamics in adjacent patches were more synchronous in H than D;” plus synchro à 4 qu'à 3 ?  
pq ?

 “the average correlation between predator and prey densities through time within a 32-mL bottle was more strongly negative in H than D” corrélation densité proie-prédat 4 est plus négative que 3  
P'tet lien avec le peak density plus grand donc plus fort prédation donc plus grand effondrement proie (avant effondrement énorme prédateur starvation) ???

 “tronger predator-prey interaction (across all densities and averaged through time) within bottles of microcosms H than D”

 “Metapopulation persistence mechanisms include rescue effects, extinction-colonization dynamics, spatial independence of dynamics, patch size effects, habitat-specific demography, and habitat dynamics.”

 “Holyoak and Ray (1999) suggest studying these mechanisms directly rather than classifying metapopulations according to theoretical “types” (source-sink, classical metapopulation, mainland-island, etc.).” a lire et faire classifs des types théoriques de métapop

 “rescue effects were suggested by a strong negative correlation between the observed probability of predator extinction from a 32-mL bottle and the proportion of bottles occupied” on présume effet sauvetage pcq Plus y a de bouteilles occupées, moins y a de proba (observée) d'extinction de prédateur

 “Second, the probability of 32-mL bottles being recolonized by predators was positively correlated with the proportion of bottles occupied” pba recolonisation predateur ↑ si proportion bouteille occupée ↑

 “Third, the probability of predators recolonizing”

 “bottles was also weakly correlated with average predator density in occupied bottles” plus les bouteilles occupées ont une grande densitée de prédateurs, plus y a de chances (légèrement) que ca recolonise

 “The presences of these factors is consistent with them contributing to the discrepancy between predicted and observed occupancy and, hence, to prolonging regional persistence.”

 “observed patch occupancy for prey was accurately predicted by equilibrium extinctioncolonization dynamics. Mean patch occupancy ( ) preˆp dicted from extinction-colonization dynamics was virtually identical to observed occupancy”

 “Despite the ability of extinction-colonization dynamics to explain patch occupancy, rescue effects were also found; there was a strong correlation between the probability of extinction from a bottle and the proportion of bottles occupied (r p 20.985”

 “Hence, prey abundance within occupied patches is influenced by, and influences, many aspects of the predator-prey interaction and is not a clear indicator of prey rescue effects”

 “theory suggests that spatial structure can stabilize spatial predator-prey systems by limiting the predators’ attack rate on the prey”

 “Hence, asynchronous density fluctuations were associated with weaker predator-prey interactions and longer predator persistence.”

 “asynchrony is a prerequisite for metapopulation persistence through either rescue effects (Brown and Kodric-Brown 1977) or extinction-colonization dynamics; if all patches declined to low abundances simultaneously, there would be no source of migrants that are the agents of recolonization and rescue.”

 “Pearson’s correlations between the proportion of patches occupied and mean abundance in occupied patches was r p 0.64, P ! .001 for predators and r p 0.66, P ! .001 for prey”

 “habitat fragmentation reduced both distribution and abundance”

 “In multispecies systems, it is also possible that some species decline in abundance during fragmentation because their predators or competitors increase in abundance” aller revoir cours bottom up et top down de l3

 “this experiment shows that habitat patch arrangement can profoundly influence predator and prey metapopulation persistence.”

 “were substantial effects on predator metapopulation persistence of the amount of patches or habitat, maximum distance between patches, average interpatch dispersal rate, and degree of interconnection of patches; this effect of habitat compartmentalization is the first demonstration that the explicit spatial arrangement of patches influences metapopulation persistence.”

 “no separate effect was found for loop structures of patches or patch similarity”

 “predator persistence was longer in loops of three patches than four patches, which indicates an interaction between patch number and arrangement.”

 “Spatial synchrony of dynamics in different patches was central to persistence. However, its effects were complex because it was correlated with extinction-colonization dynamics, rescue effects, and the strength of predator-prey coupling, which might alter the propensity for within-patch persistence”
