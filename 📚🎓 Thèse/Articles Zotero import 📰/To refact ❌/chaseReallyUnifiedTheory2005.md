#  “Towards a really unified theory for metacommunities”

 “Traditionally, community ecologists assumed that species differ in some aspects of their traits or responses to the environment (i.e. their niches), which allow them to coexist in the same habitat”

 “As an alternative to the traditional niche theory, Hubbell (2001) developed a neutral theory of community structure”

 “In the neutral theory, patterns of species diversity, relative abundance, and composition are primarily a function of the size of the metacommunity, the dispersal rate of organisms within the metacommunity, and the rates of generation (speciation) of new species”

 “Because species are assumed to be identical ecologically, Hubbell termed his a ‘neutral theory’, by direct analogy to neutral genes in population genetics.”

 “The neutral theory is valuable in its simplicity in inputs, but suffers by the limitation of its outputs. Alternatively, niche theory is less elegant (more complex) by having many more inputs, but can provide much richer insights (outputs)”

 “modern niche theory recognizes a variety of factors that influence patterns of community structure other than just consumable resources”

 “Extrinsic temporal variation.”

 “Species can coexist indefinitely in temporally variable environments if they trade-off in their response to different conditions (e.g. weather), and they can persist through unfavourable periods (e.g. through long-lived adult stages or seed-banks)”

 “A similar coexistence mechanism occurs when species differ in their susceptibility to disturbances (e.g. some stressful or mortality event) and their competitive ability”

 “Intrinsic temporal variation.”

 “Organisms themselves can create temporal variation, which in turn can allow coexistence. For example, if consumers cause their resources to cycle, and species specialize on different parts of the temporal sequence (i.e. one species is favoured when resources are common and the other species is favoured when resources are rare), they can coexist by being favoured at different times”

 “Extrinsic spatial variation.”

 “In models of resource competition, many species can coexist on two resources”

 “so long as there is spatial variation in the local ratios of those two resources and species vary in their performance on different resource-ratios”

 “Many species can also coexist on few resources when they vary in how they utilize their environment; some responding to localized resources (fine-grained) and others responding to more dispersed resources (coarse-grained)”

 “Intrinsic spatial variation.”

 “When organisms trade-off in their ability to consume resources to low levels and to find new patches, a spatial mosaic of patch quality can be created which allows species to coexist on one resource”

 “Competitively similar species can also coexist on a single resource by intrinsically generated spatial aggregation. This aggregation can be behavioural if individuals show a bias towards being near conspecifics (e.g. Zhang et al. 2004) or a result of differing dispersal probabilities and segregation if dispersal is localized”

 “Space as a resource”

 “When space itself is a resource, ‘regional trade-offs’ can allow species to coexist if they trade-off their ability to compete for resources in a patch and colonize empty patches”

 “Other species (enemies, mutualists) as limiting factors.”

 “Predators can facilitate coexistence among their prey if there is a trade-off in the prey’s ability to compete for resources and avoid predation”

 “Similarly, predators can facilitate coexistence if there is frequency dependence of predator attack on prey species as they become more common”

 “As the neutral theory disregards differences in species traits, it can say little about how fragmentation will differentially alter the composition of species, as well as their interactions with other species in the community.”

 “studies have shown that a species’ traits may correlate with its ability to invade a community”

 “Likewise, the invasibility of a community may depend on the types of species present and how similar the traits of these species are to the traits of the invader”

 “Furthermore, many invasive species may thrive because they lack natural enemies in their new habitats (the ‘enemy release hypothesis”

 “Although contentious, particularly regarding the mechanisms, studies often find that the ecosystem functioning increases with increasing species diversity”

 “A mechanism frequently invoked to explain this relationship is that species differentially utilize the environment around them (i.e. they have different niches), and that with increasing diversity, more of the available resources are utilized and overall functioning increased”

 “Because the neutral theory assumes that space is the only limiting factor and that all species are functionally equivalent, it cannot make predictions about the role of species in ecosystem functioning.”
