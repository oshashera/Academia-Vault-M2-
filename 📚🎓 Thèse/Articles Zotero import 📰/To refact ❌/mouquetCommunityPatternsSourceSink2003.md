# Community Patterns in Source‐Sink Metacommunities


 “We present a model of a source-sink competitive metacommunity, defined as a regional set of communities in which local diversity is maintained by dispersal.”

 “Local (a) diversity is maximal at an intermediate level of dispersal, whereas between-community (b) and regional (g) diversity decline as dispersal increases because of increased homogenization of the metacommunity.”

 “Local productivity and space occupation tend to decline as dispersal increases, resulting in either a hump-shaped or a positive relationship between species richness and productivity, depending on the scale considered (local or regional)”

 “studying communities as organized into networks linked by dispersal, called metacommunities”

 “Various mechanisms of species coexistence have been proposed in such a metacommunity framework. The best known is the competition-colonization trade-off”

 “where the combination of community extinction and recolonization and appropriate trade-offs between species’ competitive and colonizing abilities explain a high level of species richness.”

 “Another very important mechanism of species coexistence in metacommunities is the source-sink effect”

 “At the metacommunity scale, a source-sink”

 “or mass”

 “effect occurs because species are not excluded from communities where they are bad competitors, because they immigrate”

 “from other communities where they are good competitors.”

 “studies have provided strong evidence that the regional dimension of species interactions could promote the local coexistence of competing species through a transfer of the effects of regional habitat heterogeneity to the local scale”

 “and regional similarity between competing species”

 “This approach provides a niche-based alternative to recent neutral-based metacommunity models because coexistence results from regional niche differentiation and dispersal between communities”

 “It also differs from competition-colonization models because it does not concern transient local coexistence between species with different life cycles”

 “Here we provide such predictions for species richness, species relative abundances, and community-level functional properties (productivity and space occupation) at the local and regional scales as functions of the proportion of dispersal between communities.”

 “When dispersal was zero, dominance by the best local competitor was complete (Sp. A in fig. 1). As dispersal increased, some species were rescued from competitive exclusion because they immigrated from communities where they were dominant.”

 “The local best competitor occupied fewer sites, and species relative abundances became more equitable and independent of their local competitive abilities”

 “Under high dispersal, however, the potential for local coexistence decreased because the species that was the best competitor at the scale of the region (Sp. B in fig. 1a) progressively excluded other species from the metacommunity.”

 “The locally best competitor was excluded relatively rapidly as dispersal value increased, because the determinant of species dominance changed from local to regional competitive ability.”

 “Increasing dispersal resulted in homogenization of the species composition within the metacommunity. When dispersal was zero, local (a) diversity was minimum (one species), whereas betweencommunity (b) and regional (g) diversities were maximum”

 “in each community a different species was the locally best competitor.”

 “As dispersal increased to an intermediate value amax, more species were maintained by immigration above the extinction threshold, and local diversity increased. Communities then became more similar in species composition, and between-community diversity decreased.”

 “Because all species remained in the metacommunity, regional diversity remained constant”

 “When dispersal was greater than amax, local diversity decreased because the best competitor at the scale of the region dominated each community, and other species were progressively excluded. In this case, the species that were not excluded were present in all communities, betweencommunity diversity was zero, and regional diversity was equal to local diversity and decreased.”

 “Finally, when dispersal was highest, the metacommunity functioned as a single large community, in which the regionally best competitor excluded all other species; local and regional diversity were minimum.”

 “Regional diversity was highest at high values of regional heterogeneity”

 “and low dispersal.”

 “At low dispersal, regardless of regional species richness, the local species richness was limited by the locally dominant species, and the resulting relationship between local and regional diversity was saturated.”

 “Community-Level Functional Properties”

 “The average pro”

 “ductivity and space occupation decreased as dispersal increased”

 “As dispersal increased, species with low local reproductive rates were maintained by immigration, occupying more sites, but, on average, fewer sites were occupied in the whole community, and species rescued by immigration had lower cik, which resulted in decreasing average productivity.”

 “Because the local species richness shows a hump-shaped relationship with dispersal (fig. 3)”

 “whereas productivity continuously decreases (fig. 5a),”

 “a humped curve emerged, which shows that at the local scale the relationship between productivity and local species diversity can be positive or negative depending on which side of the hump is observed.” 5b

 “At the regional scale, however, the relationship between regional species richness and productivity was either positive or null (fig. 5c) because the regional species richness was constant or decreased with increasing dispersal (fig. 3).”

 “as dispersal success decreased, higher dispersal values were needed before any species could be rescued from competitive exclusion and before exclusion by the regionally best competitor occurred”

 “at high dispersal values species extinction resulted from both competition with the regionally competitive species and the loss of too many individuals during the dispersal event.”

 “the importance of regional dynamics decreased as dispersal success decreased,”

 “higher values of dispersal were needed to generate the same effects of dispersal on local and regional coexistence.”

 “effect of dispersal success on local productivity depended on dispersal values (fig. 6c). When dispersal was zero, productivity was high regardless of dispersal success. For intermediate values of dispersal, because the intensity of regional dynamics decreased as dispersal success decreased, the negative effect of dispersal on productivity was buffered, and local productivity was higher for low dispersal-success values. Finally, for high values of dispersal ( ), too many individuals were lost during the a 1 0.8 dispersal phase, local species abundances decreased strongly, and productivity was lower for low dispersalsuccess values.”

 “Dispersal as a Link between Local and Regional Species Richness”

 “We found a humped relationship between local (a) species richness and dispersal values”

 “Dispersal acts to transfer the effects of regional heterogeneity to the local scale, such that species that can only coexist regionally when communities are closed also coexist locally when communities are open. Because dispersal leads to a progressive homogenization of the metacommunity, it also has an overall negative effect on local and regional species richness from intermediate to high dispersal values”

 “the shape of the relationship between local and regional species richness was a function of dispersal between communities”

 “Our metacommunity model shows that a simple mechanism of local interaction can generate different relationships between local and regional species richness given particular values for the dispersal between communities and the degree of regional heterogeneity. Dispersal acts as a homogenizing factor, transferring the effect of regional heterogeneity to the local scale and thus from the b to the a component of species diversity”

 “the shape of the relationship between local and regional species richness cannot reveal the underlying ecological processes. Detailed knowledge of dispersal processes and species interactions is necessary to interpretation of these relationships”

 “Species Abundance Patterns”

 “species abundance patterns vary with the level of dispersal between communities. They are therefore functions of both dispersal and local and regional competitive abilities rather than of local competitive ability alone.”

 “High dispersal tends to homogenize the metacommunity, making the species rank abundance relationship steeper. Moreover, we show that spatial scale has a critical effect on the shape of these patterns.”

 “found this geometric distribution”

 “whereas in our model, it results from competitive exclusion by the locally best competitor”

 “we show that the distribution reverts to a geometric series at very high values of dispersal because of competitive exclusion by the regionally best competitor. Our source-sink metacommunity model based on strong competitive interactions and regional niche differentiation therefore has the same predictive power for species abundance patterns as does the neutral model”

 “Relationship between Productivity and Species Richness”

 “Our model stresses the influence of dominant species on community-level functional properties such as productivity. As we have shown, the most locally abundant species is not necessarily the best local competitor, that is, the most productive species”

 “When dispersal increases from low to intermediate,”

 “The result is a negative relationship between local species richness and productivity. At the regional scale, however, regional species richness does not vary and has no relationship with productivity.”

 “When dispersal further increases to high values, local species richness and regional species richness become equal and decrease just as does productivity, thereby generating a positive correlation between productivity and species richness at both local and regional scales”

 “our model demonstrates the possibility of a homogenization effect at high dispersal values, which results in a decline in species richness and productivity. This result suggest that, in the context of a metacommunity, the shape of the relationship between species richness and productivity will result from a coupling between local and regional niche differentiation and dispersal of organisms between communities.”

 “Our work shows that dispersal has both positive and negative effects on species richness (fig. 3) and that these effects are buffered when species dispersal success varies (fig. 6b). Therefore, when systems are organized into metacommunities, the consequences of altering the flux of individuals between communities can be positive, negative, or null depending on dispersal before the perturbation and species characteristics. Connectivity (dispersal in our model) must therefore be a key issue in ecological management decisions”

 “Stochastic extinction might be”

 “an important process, particularly for metacommunities constituted of small populations, and it would be an interesting extension of the model to explore”

 “if we are to understand the different kinds of mechanisms acting to promote coexistence in such multiscale organized systems (i.e., competitioncolonization, species sorting, neutral, and source-sink). Species diversity in natural communities probably results from a combination of these different mechanisms along a continuum, and their relative contributions to phenomena that ecologists observe in the field must now be determined.”
