 “the recent "explosion of spatially explicit theory” “suggest a number of emerging principles for species conservation.”

 “One of these principle is that how habitats are arranged in space can mitigate the risks of species extinctions from habitat loss. I tested this by estimating the relative importance of habitat loss and habitat spatial pattern (fragmentation) on population extinction”

 “I therefore suggest that, in fact, details of how habitats are arranged cannot usually mitigate the risks of habitat loss. Conservation efforts should be aimed foremost at stopping habitat loss and at habitat restoration” 🖋

“Loss and fragmentation of habitat result in reduced population sizes, which increases the probability of extinction by demographic and/or environmental stochasticity (Burkey 1995)” 🖋


 “effects of habitat amount and fragmentation are confounded in many studies that claim to show an effect of fragmentation. This arises through frequent use of the term "fragmentation" to mean simultaneously both loss and fragmentation of habitats”

 “Furthermore, negative effects of decreasing size and increasing isolation of habitat patches often are interpreted as fragmentation effects”

 “If habitat loss results in a constant number of smaller patches, then patch size effects are due to habitat loss alone. If whole patches are removed from the landscape, then isolation of remaining patches increases but fragmentation per se is actually decreased because there are fewer patches” 🖋

 “Only when the number of patches increases by the breaking apart of habitats do we find that both habitat loss and fragmentation _per se_ are involved in the decreasing size and increasing isolation of habitat patches”

 “When habitat amount is held constant or controlled for, fragmentation generally has either no effect (Middleton and Merriam 1983, Hamel et al. 1993) or a negative effect on population survival”

 “habitat loss and fragmentation typically occur together, it is not clear which process has the larger effect on extinction.”

 “If fragmentation is important, then within some limits it should be possible to mitigate effects of habitat loss by ensuring that remaining habitat is not fragmented.”

 “Amount of breeding habitat had a much greater effect than FRAG on extinction probability”

 “Again, COVER has a large effect on extinction time; no effect of FRAG was detected.”

 “although the movement assumptions are unrealistic for many organisms, they are conservative in the sense that they increase the likelihood of observing an effect of fragmentation on extinction”

 “The simulation results suggest that habitat loss has a much larger effect than habitat fragmentation per se on population extinction.”

 “McGarigal and McComb” “ found that ‘with the exception of a few 'edge' species, variation in abundance among landscapes was more strongly related to changes in habitat area; habitat configuration was of secondary importance’ ” 🖋

 “important to correctly define the species' habitat” 

 “in the context of forest loss and fragmentation, loss of habitat is greater than the loss of forest for forest interior species, and loss of habitat is less than the loss of forest for forest edge species (there even may be an increase in habitat amount for edge specie”

 “some edge species” “have negative effects on habitat quality for other species (e.g., neotropical migrants) thus reducing or eliminating their reproductive success in forest edge”

 “Also, for any species there is a lower limit to the size of a patch that can act as breeding habitat”

“The results suggest that when breeding habitat covers more than 20% of the landscape, survival is virtually ensured no matter how fragmented the habitat is”
