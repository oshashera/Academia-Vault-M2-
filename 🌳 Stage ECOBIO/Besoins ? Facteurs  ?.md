- food : 
	- "winter-active Collembola probably fed on resources from snow and partly on resources from litter depending on the species or their microhabitats" (Hao et al, Snow microhabitats provide food resources for winter-active Collembola, 2020)
	- Those  food ressources include a wide variety of bacterias found in snow and litter (Hao et al, Snow microhabitats provide food resources for winter-active Collembola, 2020)
	- Collembola are freezing susceptible (Woud 1987 Seasonal changes in cold hardiness of temperate Collembola)

The slugs ate more when the DMC was low. Thus, these results suggest that slugs prefer leaves that have grown in the sun and have high water content                                                                 |                    |

| Carnivores slug => worms, slugs snails, centipedes | Taylor (1902–07, p. 4) said of Testacella, ‘They are predaceous and very voracious and not only prey upon worms, but will also devour slugs, snails, centipedes, and even small individuals of their own kind.’        |

### Structure sol

Trait `root type, root architecture` 
Favorise décompaction sol :

- 1) **Les racines pivotantes (taproot)** :  racines principales qui plongent profond Décompacte sols durs et argileux. (décompactant fort)
- 2) **Les racines fasciculées (fibrous roots)** : nombreuses et horizontales => brise couches compactées. (modérément décompactant)
- 3) **Les racines traçantes (runner roots)** :  horizontalement sous la surface (peu décompactant)
- 4)**Les racines superficielles (shallow roots)** : Ne pénètrent pas profondément dans sol, mais peut assouplir la couche superficielle (vraiment peu décompactant)

Favorite wintering sites are well aerated, and winter minimum temperatures are relatively high (58, 183). <br>2) Food conditions. For example, exclusively spermophagous Ophonus spp. are present in open habitats where seeds of Umbelliferae are available, whereas polyphagous Harpalus spp. aggregate in crops (209). Marked Poecilus cupreus and Pterostichus melanurius moved from winter wheat to a weed strip within the wheat field (where feeding conditions were better) much more frequently than they moved the reverse direction (128). <br>3) Presence and distribution of competitors. For example, forest carabids in Finland were influenced by the distribution of Formica ant species (141). <br>4) Life history and season. Amara plebeja, for instance, has **different hibernation (woodland) and reproduction (grassland) habitats**. The beetles fly between habitats in spring and autumn. Flight muscles are temporarily autolysed between flights, then completely reconstructed for the return flight. In the autumn, they fly toward woodland silhouette shapes (190) | Sunderland 1996       |

"Carabids are among the most abundant and diverse families of arthropod generalist predators in temperate agricultural fields" Sacco 2024
"in temperate agroecosystems, carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) are key members of epigaeic invertebrate assemblages, with the potential to provide valuable ecological services." Bennewicz 2020
