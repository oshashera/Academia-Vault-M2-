> [!cite] Biodiversity crisis or sixth  mass extinction ?  Does the current anthropogenic biodiversity crisis really qualify as a mass extinction ?
Sixth extinction is not exact but quite accurate considering the scope and rates^["A couple of decades ago, some scientists suggested that the ongoing anthropogenic biodiversity crisis is similar in terms of scope to the five major mass extinctions that occurred in past geologic times and coined the term “sixth extinction”]
Causes of extinction :"including overhunting, replacement by introduced species, deforestation, habitat destruction, increased land use, and/or introduction of alien pathogens. Size and connectivity constraints make oceanic islands especially sensitive to these disturbances", not even considering DARK extinction (exctinction before being discovered)
