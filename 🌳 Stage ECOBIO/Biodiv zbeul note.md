> [!cite] Biodiversity crisis or sixth  mass extinction ?  Does the current anthropogenic biodiversity crisis really qualify as a mass extinction ?
Sixth extinction is not exact but quite accurate considering the scope and rates^["A couple of decades ago, some scientists suggested that the ongoing anthropogenic biodiversity crisis is similar in terms of scope to the five major mass extinctions that occurred in past geologic times and coined the term “sixth extinction”]
Causes of extinction :"including overhunting, replacement by introduced species, deforestation, habitat destruction, increased land use, and/or introduction of alien pathogens. Size and connectivity constraints make oceanic islands especially sensitive to these disturbances", not even considering DARK extinction (exctinction before being discovered)
Conservation is very important, but "If we were hypothetically able to preserve every single species living on the planet, we would prevent background extinction, stop natural selection and, as a consequence, evolution. The living world is what it is thanks to the speciation/extinction balance, which is fundamental for evolutionary diversification."
