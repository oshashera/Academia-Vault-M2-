Sixth extinction is not exact but quite accurate considering the scope and rates^["A couple of decades ago, some scientists suggested that the ongoing anthropogenic biodiversity crisis is similar in terms of scope to the five major mass extinctions that occurred in past geologic times and coined the term “sixth extinction”]

Causes of extinction :"including overhunting, replacement by introduced species, deforestation, habitat destruction, increased land use, and/or introduction of alien pathogens. Size and connectivity constraints make oceanic islands especially sensitive to these disturbances", not even considering DARK extinction (exctinction before being discovered)

Conservation is very important, but "If we were hypothetically able to preserve every single species living on the planet, we would prevent background extinction, stop natural selection and, as a consequence, evolution. The living world is what it is thanks to the speciation/extinction balance, which is fundamental for evolutionary diversification."

>[!cite] Towards quantifying the mass extinction debt of the Anthropocene
>"Even if human interference ceased immediately, extinctions would continue owing to the phenomenon of ‘extinction debt’. Extinction debt describes the lag time between an initial perturbation and the extinction of species, as populations decline."
>
>"Secondary extinctions describe the cascading loss of species within an ecosystem, indirectly following on from a smaller number of initial extinctions" 
>
>"The leading threats to species today include habitat loss and land-use change [10] such as agriculture, logging and mining."

>"Human activity has already exterminated 100s of species, but an uncertain number are bound for extinction through extinction debt and secondary cascades"
