Landscape ecology through PMM has limitations ^["Recent research recognizes some limitations of the patch-mosaic model (PMM), including the landscape metrics based on it, for capturing landscape heterogeneity and measuring functionality. Collapsing land cover information into nominal classes complicates identification of ecologically meaningful relationships and effective management."] 
Metrics can be limiting or confusing ^["Contributing to these uncertainties, the scale dependency of many metrics across both grain (i.e., resolution) and study area extent confounds relationships between ecological processes and spatial patterns"] 
Our main mean of studying heterogeneity is processing this heterogeneity with issues ^["Underlying these issues remains the simple fact that conventional landscape metrics are built on the patch-mosaic model (PMM), which simplifies landscapes into a mosaic of discrete patches that may not adequately capture ecological heterogeneity"]
Rise of environmental gradient lenses, not without critiques too^["One stream within the literature advocates conceptualizing the landscape as an environmental gradient [29–34], the patterns of which can be quantified through alternate surface metrics that measure heterogeneity in gradient datasets [35]. However, this gradient surface model (GSM) is not without critique"]
Conventional landscape metrics *vs* surface metrics (gradient)^["One stream within the literature advocates conceptualizing the landscape as an environmental gradient [29–34], the patterns of which can be quantified through alternate surface metrics that measure heterogeneity in gradient datasets [35]. However, this gradient surface model (GSM) is not without critique"]
