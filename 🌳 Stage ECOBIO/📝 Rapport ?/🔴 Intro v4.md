Théorie métacommunauté : 
Métacommunauté = definition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view

easy to define local communities wherein species interact by affecting each other’s demographic rates  and a metacommunity as a set of local communities that exchange colonists of multiple species

“In this paper, we restrict ourselves only to metacommunity definitions that consider space implicitly and not explicitly (e.g. spatially explicit models where the location of individuals is tracked). We recognize, however, that there are some important phenomena that depend on spatially determined dynamics that our approach will consequently overlook.” (Leibold et al., 2004, p. 602)

# Introduction

Since a few decades, Earth's biosphere has been steadily degrading, mostly due to anthropic activities. In 2023, was published an updated estimation of Earth's boundaries, that stated that 6 out of the 9 critical boundaries were already transgressed, thus "suggesting that Earth is now well outside of the safe operating space for humanity" **(Richardson et al., 2023)**. Those boundaries and their respective states can be found in **figure 1**. Out of the 6 unsafe boundaries, 5 are especially worrying and interlinked : climate change intensification, novel entities introduction in the environment  (increase in the diversity and amount of anthropic chemicals), biogeochemical flows disruptions, land-use change and biodiversity erosion are all threatening  humanity's ability to sustain itself (food security) and Earth's biosphere as a whole. The amount of effort displayed for conservation and restoration purpose is not sufficient to balance our collective impact on the environment : for instance, in the span of 27 years, the amount of flying insects in Germany's protected area has steadily declined by more than 27% (Hallman et al., 2017) and the amount of threatened species on the UICN red-list has increased five-fold in the 2000-2005 period. However bleak the coming decades may seem, many levers for action have not yet been used to their full potential. 
Agriculture as a whole is both a hindrance and a lever for an ecological transition. Indeed, the dominant agricultural model is influencing all of the five previously mentioned boundaries : its expansion and spatial simplification ("agricultural reparcelling" in France and most notably in Brittany) in the last century has been a major driver of land-use change, its mechanization and intensification (fertilizers and pesticides) are increasing greenhouse-gas emissions -thus fueling climate change-, and coupled with its homogenisation (monoculture) it introduces a lot of novel entities in the environment, whose effect are spatially decorrelated from its initial application (e.g. fertilizer excess transported to estuaries by water runoff causing "green tides" of algae in Brittany). Biogeochemical cycles are disrupted by agricultural activities such as : the carbon cycle (tillage practices, crop residues buring and mechanization), the nitrogen and the phosphorus cycles (fertilizers leaching), or the water cycle through water runoffs due soil compaction. Finally, the dominant agricultural model has adverse impacts on biodiversity : land-use change can reduce semi-natural habitat amounts and suitability, biogeochemical cycle disruption change ecological niche repartition

to biodiversity through land artificialization, intensive usage of chemicals (pesticides and fertilizers), and landscape simplification (e.g. the “reparcelling” in France and most notably in Brittany). These practices have contributed to the rapid erosion of many plant and animal populations, especially in the vicinity of agricultural lands (ref ?), although those issues can also be noticeable further aways from farms (e.g. the “green tides” on the shores of Brittany) . On the other hand, agriculture also represents a powerful lever for ecological transition : By rethinking farming practices (local scale) and the management of agricultural landscapes (landscape scale), it is possible to reconcile food production and biodiversity conservation, notably by integrating favorable structures such as hedges, flower strips and environmental fallows.

Figure 1 : 2023 estimates of all nine planetary boundaries **(from Richardson et al., 2023)**
Six of the nine boundaries are transgressed. In addition, ocean acidification is approaching its planetary boundary. The green zone is the safe operating space (below the boundary). Yellow to red represents the zone of increasing risk. Purple indicates the high-risk zone where interglacial Earth system conditions are transgressed with high confidence. Values for control variables are normalized so that the origin represents mean Holocene conditions and the planetary boundary (lower end of zone of increasing risk, dotted circle) lies at the same radius for all boundaries (except for the wedges representing green and blue water, see main text). Wedge lengths are scaled logarithmically. The upper edges of the wedges for the novel entities and the genetic diversity component of the biosphere integrity boundaries are blurred either because the upper end of the zone of increasing risk has not yet been quantitatively defined (novel entities) or because the current value is known only with great uncertainty (loss of genetic diversity). Both, however, are well outside of the safe operating space. Transgression of these boundaries reflects unprecedented human disruption of Earth system but is associated with large scientific uncertainties
