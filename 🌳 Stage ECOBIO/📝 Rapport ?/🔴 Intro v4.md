Théorie métacommunauté : 
Métacommunauté = definition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view

easy to define local communities wherein species interact by affecting each other’s demographic rates  and a metacommunity as a set of local communities that exchange colonists of multiple species

“In this paper, we restrict ourselves only to metacommunity definitions that consider space implicitly and not explicitly (e.g. spatially explicit models where the location of individuals is tracked). We recognize, however, that there are some important phenomena that depend on spatially determined dynamics that our approach will consequently overlook.” (Leibold et al., 2004, p. 602)

# Introduction

### A dire situation

Since a few decades, Earth's biosphere has been steadily degrading, mostly due to anthropic activities. In 2023, was published an updated estimation of Earth's boundaries, that stated that 6 out of the 9 critical boundaries were already transgressed, thus "suggesting that Earth is now well outside of the safe operating space for humanity" **(Richardson et al., 2023)**. Those boundaries and their respective states can be found in **figure 1**. Out of the 6 unsafe boundaries, 5 are especially worrying and interlinked : climate change intensification, novel entities introduction in the environment  (increase in the diversity and amount of anthropic chemicals), biogeochemical flows disruptions, land-use change and biodiversity erosion are all threatening  humanity's ability to sustain itself (food security) and Earth's biosphere as a whole. The amount of effort displayed for conservation and restoration purpose is not sufficient to balance our collective impact on the environment : for instance, in the span of 27 years, the amount of flying insects in Germany's protected area has steadily declined by more than 27% (**Hallman et al., 2017**) and the amount of threatened species on the UICN red-list has increased five-fold in the 2000-2005 period. However bleak the coming decades may seem, many levers for action have not yet been used to their full potential. 

### Agriculture and biodiversity

Agriculture as a whole is both a hindrance and a lever for an ecological transition. Indeed, the dominant agricultural model is influencing all of the five previously mentioned boundaries : its expansion and spatial simplification ("agricultural reparcelling" in France and most notably in Brittany) in the last century has been a major driver of land-use change, its mechanization and intensification (fertilizers and pesticides) are increasing greenhouse-gas emissions -thus fueling climate change-, and coupled with its homogenisation (monoculture) it introduces a lot of novel entities in the environment, whose effect are spatially decorrelated from its initial application (e.g. fertilizer excess transported to estuaries by water runoff causing "green tides" of algae in Brittany). Biogeochemical cycles are disrupted by agricultural activities such as : the carbon cycle (tillage practices, crop residues buring and mechanization), the nitrogen and the phosphorus cycles (fertilizers leaching), or the water cycle through water runoffs due soil compaction. Finally, the dominant agricultural model has adverse impacts on biodiversity : land-use change can reduce semi-natural habitat amounts and suitability, disruption of biogeochemical cycles changes the distribution and quality of nutrients and other ressources, and the use of pesticides has negative impacts on the surrounding biodiversity (e.g. Soil fauna, **Beaumelle et al., 2023**)
On the other hand, agriculture also represents a powerful lever for ecological transition : By rethinking farming practices (local scale) and the management of agricultural landscapes (landscape scale), it is possible to reconcile food production and biodiversity conservation, notably by integrating favorable structures such as hedges, flower strips and environmental fallows.

Biodiversity can be considered both as a resource to be preserved and as a tool to be mobilized because of the ecosystem functions it provides, from which we derive ecosystem services (**MEA, 2005**) of interest. Since biodiversity loss restrains ecosystem processes (**Correi & Lopes, 2023**), increasing biodiversity in agricultural landscapes would improve ecosystem services provision (**Altieri, 1999**) . Restoring and increasing biodiversity in agricultural landscapes might also allow to reduce -or at least prevent its increase- the use of pesticides, through biological pest control. For instance, the abundance and diversity of crop pests' natural enemies are both positively affected by an increase in landscape complexity (**Chaplin-Kramer et al.,2011**; **Shackelford et**
**al., 2013**; **Karp et al.,2018**). 

Thus, agroecosystems are at the intersection between productive functions (for human consumption) and ecological issues. These anthropized systems must not only ensure food security, but also play a role in ecological regulation, by supporting biodiversity. But to ensure worldwide food safety, an "ecological modernization" of cropping systems and their spatial integration is in order. While implementing more "biodiversity-based" systems (**Duru et al., 2015a,b**) is a step in the good direction, there is a joint need of ecosystem services (ES) provision maximization through biodiversity increase. From this issue stems the need to develop approaches that enable improved management of biodiversity in agricultural areas, reconciling farmers' economic requirements with sustained ecological functions.Fortunately, there already are (potential) conservation levers suited for agrosystems : At the local scale, the aforementioned implementation of floral strips and hedgerows constitutes a simple solution. However, the landscape scale, although less studied, has the potential to be more efficient on the long term.

<center><b>Figure 1</b> : 2023 estimates of all nine planetary boundaries <b>(from Richardson et al., 2023)</b></center>
<center>Six of the nine boundaries are transgressed. In addition, ocean acidification is approaching its planetary boundary. The green zone is the safe operating space (below the boundary). Yellow to red represents the zone of increasing risk. Purple indicates the high-risk zone where interglacial Earth system conditions are transgressed with high confidence. Values for control variables are normalized so that the origin represents mean Holocene conditions and the planetary boundary (lower end of zone of increasing risk, dotted circle) lies at the same radius for all boundaries (except for the wedges representing green and blue water). Wedge lengths are scaled logarithmically. The upper edges of the wedges for the novel entities and the genetic diversity component of the biosphere integrity boundaries are blurred either because the upper end of the zone of increasing risk has not yet been quantitatively defined (novel entities) or because the current value is known only with great uncertainty (loss of genetic diversity). Both, however, are well outside of the safe operating space. Transgression of these boundaries reflects unprecedented human disruption of Earth system but is associated with large scientific uncertainties.

### Landscape (,) ecology

Landscape-scale research approach on biodiversity appears to be a promising approach because of its ability to take account of spatial variations in resources and  species pool for more precise and impactful management of biodiversity. Indeed, landscape greatly impacts biodiversity by constraining dispersion of organism or by its provision capacity in terms of resources (food) and habitat (shelter). 

In order to study this, we made use of landscape ecology, an ecology discipline that aims to take into account the spatial aspect of ecosystems to further our understanding of biodiversity. Landscape structure has been shown to strongly influence biodiversity especially through the heterogeneity of the landscape mosaic (i.e. pattern variations, spatial repartition of habitats or ressources of interest). Both : compositional and configurational heterogeneity (**F. Burel & J. Baudry, 2nd Ed, 2003**) can be described.  Compositional heterogeneity (types and proportions of landscape elements) : refers to the diversity and relative abundance of different land cover types, habitat patches, or ecosystem components within a landscape. This concept is central to understanding biodiversity patterns, as it influences species richness, community composition, and ecosystem processes. Fragmentation, the process of splitting and reducing the size of patches, often increases compositional heterogeneity by creating a mosaic of different land cover types (**F. Burel & J. Baudry, 2nd Ed, 2003**). Configurational heterogeneity (spatial arrangement and geometry of landscape element) : refers to the spatial arrangement, shape, size, and distribution of landscape elements, as well as their connectivity. It describes how patches of different land cover types are organized in space and how their configuration influences ecological processes such as species movement, gene flow, and resource availability. Connectivity is the functional linkage between habitat patches or landscape elements  and is notably determined by the structural arrangement of patches -e.g., their proximity, shape, distribution and presence of linear elements connecting them- (**F. Burel & J. Baudry, 2nd Ed, 2003**).

Although at first the two disciplines evolved independently, landscape ecology is related to the metacommunity theory (**Leibold et al., 2004**), itself derived from the metapopulation theory (**Hanski, 1991**) which appeared from the island biogeography theory (**MacArthur & Wilson, 1967**). A metacommunity can be defined as “a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species” : In the metacommunity theory, under the species-sorting paradigm, patch quality and spatial repartition are acknowledged to affect species dispersal, which is a key process in  biodiversity structuring at landscape level (**Leibold et al., 2004**).

Landscape ecology can function under a lot of different paradigm, although the classical one is the "landscape mosaic" paradigm (**Foreman, 1995**). This paradigm perceives the landscape as a collection of different habitats divided into patches. It also states that the entirety of the mosaic is relevant in ecological processes, and thus that the target habitat should not be considered alone (**Wiens JA, 1995**). While this paradigm does take into account the whole landscape, it still has a few shortcomings, the main one being that its description of the landscape mosaic is based on land-use. Land-use typologies are inherently anthropocentric, as their discrete categories are only dictated by the human perception of those land-use, which varies amongst different organisms (**F. Burel & J. Baudry, 2nd Ed, 2003**; **Dennis, Shreeve and Van Diek, 2003**; **Fahrig et al., 2011**). Relevant critics of this approach claim that the discrete (i.e. categorical) representation of environmental variables often distorts the true heterogeneity of the system and that "major discontinuities in underlying environmental variation are represented by discrete boundaries between plots [,] all other variation is subsumed within the plots and is either ignored or considered irrelevant" (**McGarigal & Cushman, 2005**).

In order to better account for the varying needs in resources and habitats of varying taxa, functional ecology might be a relevant avenue to explore. In this subdiscipline, biodiversity is understood as a set of functions, characterized using the concept of traits. Those functional traits are usually defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits impacting the fitness of the organism presenting those traits (**Violle et al., 2007**). Functional traits offer a mechanistic link between organisms and the resources they use, and have the potential to predict biodiversity patterns across spatial and temporal scales (**Liu et al., 2024**). Rather than relying on species, the functional trait approach describes how organisms interact with their environment, shape community assembly, and influence ecosystem functioning and services—including in agricultural or managed landscapes. Functional traits can be divided into to broad categories "response traits" and "effect traits": “response” traits, inform how species may respond to environmental changes, whereas "effect" traits inform how species will affect ecosystem functioning. Using functional traits as a whole could allow for a prospective approach to species distribution and dynamics, and thus to landscapes evolution too (**Kearney et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2024**). Under Hutchinson’s (non-functional) niche concept, the whole species’ tolerances and resource use are conceived as a multidimensional space, however with a trait-based approach, accuracy can be improved by explicitly linking traits to niche dimensions (**Violle & Jiang, 2009**). Incorporating regionally representative trait data -not currently possible with the completion state of trait databases- could enable landscape-level models that support functional landscape planning and biodiversity forecasting. This internship will mainly use effect traits to characterize habitat and resource provisioning for organisms of interest.

Hence arises the following question : could landscape ecology through the use of a functional lens allow for better understanding of biodiversity pattern ? The association of the two ecological disciplines to form "functional landscapes" would offer a wide range of possible approaches. This concept is not yet fully charted, although a few relevant articles can already be found, mainly for pollinators. 
A 2003 paper stated that "when resources are not compact but diffuse, the bounds of the habitat are far from obvious. In these situations, there is no reason why a habitat should be an obvious spatial structure"(Dennis et al., 2003). In the same paper, the authors justify this paradigm shift by highlighting the risk that a narrow focus on habitat patches and meta-population modelling oversimplifies ecological reality, making it difficult to advocate for increased landscape complexity to stakeholders by only focusing on biodiversity "reserves". 3 years later, the same authors produced a paper calling for the elaboration of resource-based approaches of (butterfly) habitat and the creation of databases of species resource requirements (Dennis et al., 2006). Only a year after would a first application of this concept be published (resource-based approach to butterfly habitat; Vanreusel & Van Dyck, 2007) that would allow to recognize zones with the "highest potential for habitat restoration". 
All those papers paved the way for the integration of functional approaches in the resource-habitat view. In 2011, a paper distinguished between "structural" and "functional" landscape heterogeneity, emphasizing that the latter accounts for the ecological functions (e.g., food provision, nesting, dispersal) that landscape elements offer to focal species (Fahrig et al,.2001).  They proposed to create functional cover typologies, and to associate these cover with a suitability index varying for different taxa ("dangerous", "neutral", "beneficial"). New measures of landscape heterogeneity would use cover types richness and evenness (possibly combined into a shannon index). The authors justify this approach arguing that a function-based perspective is more informative for biodiversity conservation. However, they warn that greater descriptive detail does not necessarily lead to better predictive accuracy and call for replicated studies across diverse agricultural contexts to test this assumption (Fahrig et al., 2011). Although we do agree with the assumptions of this article, the starting point of our reflection was a paper published in 2023 by Alignier et al., which produced floral resource maps based on land-cover types, using floral functional traits (see figure 2). We assume that studying landscape through functional lenses, although complex to implement, has potential for landscape management, assessment of landscape resistance and resilience against changing climatic conditions, and perhaps even sufficient biodiversity prediction power that it could help settle the land-sparing/land-sharing conundrum.

The overarching issue addressed by this internship is the advancement of the concept of functional landscapes. We especially aim to create a methodology that allows us to generate and analyse functional landscapes for agricultural landscapes, although it should be possible to adapt the resulting methodology for other types of landscapes. Our underlying hypothesis is that functional landscapes described on trait-based approaches are better predictors of biodiversity variation and distribution in fields. We also assume that trait prediction power varies depending on target taxa and across spatial scales. 

Starting from plant census and SIG data we developed -through literature analysis and R/SIG manipulation- a methodology that produces landscapes’ functional maps and key indicators to quantify and analyse them, and perhaps be a great indicator of intra-field taxa diversity or abundance by using the functional trait composition and configuration of the surrounding landscape. As this internship is part of the ConservEs european project that aims to identify whether floral strips and hedgerows (alone or combined) have positive effects on biodiversity, we also aimed to compare the effect of a simple hedge versus a flower strip adjacent to a hedge.  While this approach was initially made to be tested on 6 taxa (carabids, weeds, snails & slugs, parasitoids, pollinators, aphids), after careful selection of data (detailled in the next sections) we settled to test this new approach on a focal taxa - carabid beetles, a highly diverse group, including both (i) species that act as natural enemies of crop pests due to their generalist and opportunistic feeding habits, and (2) some granivorous species (particularly within the genera _Amara_, _Harpalus_, and _Zabrus_) which may have negative impacts on crops.
