Théorie métacommunauté : 
Métacommunauté = definition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view

easy to define local communities wherein species interact by affecting each other’s demographic rates  and a metacommunity as a set of local communities that exchange colonists of multiple species

“In this paper, we restrict ourselves only to metacommunity definitions that consider space implicitly and not explicitly (e.g. spatially explicit models where the location of individuals is tracked). We recognize, however, that there are some important phenomena that depend on spatially determined dynamics that our approach will consequently overlook.” (Leibold et al., 2004, p. 602)

# Introduction

### A dire situation

Since a few decades, Earth's biosphere has been steadily degrading, mostly due to anthropic activities. In 2023, was published an updated estimation of Earth's boundaries, that stated that 6 out of the 9 critical boundaries were already transgressed, thus "suggesting that Earth is now well outside of the safe operating space for humanity" **(Richardson et al., 2023)**. Those boundaries and their respective states can be found in **figure 1**. Out of the 6 unsafe boundaries, 5 are especially worrying and interlinked : climate change intensification, novel entities introduction in the environment  (increase in the diversity and amount of anthropic chemicals), biogeochemical flows disruptions, land-use change and biodiversity erosion are all threatening  humanity's ability to sustain itself (food security) and Earth's biosphere as a whole. The amount of effort displayed for conservation and restoration purpose is not sufficient to balance our collective impact on the environment : for instance, in the span of 27 years, the amount of flying insects in Germany's protected area has steadily declined by more than 27% (**Hallman et al., 2017**) and the amount of threatened species on the UICN red-list has increased five-fold in the 2000-2005 period. However bleak the coming decades may seem, many levers for action have not yet been used to their full potential. 

### Agriculture and biodiversity

Agriculture as a whole is both a hindrance and a lever for an ecological transition. Indeed, the dominant agricultural model is influencing all of the five previously mentioned boundaries : its expansion and spatial simplification ("agricultural reparcelling" in France and most notably in Brittany) in the last century has been a major driver of land-use change, its mechanization and intensification (fertilizers and pesticides) are increasing greenhouse-gas emissions -thus fueling climate change-, and coupled with its homogenisation (monoculture) it introduces a lot of novel entities in the environment, whose effect are spatially decorrelated from its initial application (e.g. fertilizer excess transported to estuaries by water runoff causing "green tides" of algae in Brittany). Biogeochemical cycles are disrupted by agricultural activities such as : the carbon cycle (tillage practices, crop residues buring and mechanization), the nitrogen and the phosphorus cycles (fertilizers leaching), or the water cycle through water runoffs due soil compaction. Finally, the dominant agricultural model has adverse impacts on biodiversity : land-use change can reduce semi-natural habitat amounts and suitability, disruption of biogeochemical cycles changes the distribution and quality of nutrients and other ressources, and the use of pesticides has negative impacts on the surrounding biodiversity (e.g. Soil fauna, **Beaumelle et al., 2023**)
On the other hand, agriculture also represents a powerful lever for ecological transition : By rethinking farming practices (local scale) and the management of agricultural landscapes (landscape scale), it is possible to reconcile food production and biodiversity conservation, notably by integrating favorable structures such as hedges, flower strips and environmental fallows.

Biodiversity can be considered both as a resource to be preserved and as a tool to be mobilized because of the ecosystem functions it provides, from which we derive ecosystem services (**MEA, 2005**) of interest. Since biodiversity loss restrains ecosystem processes (**Correi & Lopes, 2023**), increasing biodiversity in agricultural landscapes would improve ecosystem services provision (**Altieri, 1999**) . Restoring and increasing biodiversity in agricultural landscapes might also allow to reduce -or at least prevent its increase- the use of pesticides, through biological pest control. For instance, the abundance and diversity of crop pests' natural enemies are both positively affected by an increase in landscape complexity (**Chaplin-Kramer et al.,2011**; **Shackelford et**
**al., 2013**; **Karp et al.,2018**). 

Thus, agroecosystems are at the intersection between productive functions (for human consumption) and ecological issues. These anthropized systems must not only ensure food security, but also play a role in ecological regulation, by supporting biodiversity. But to ensure worldwide food safety, an "ecological modernization" of cropping systems and their spatial integration is in order. While implementing more "biodiversity-based" systems (**Duru et al., 2015a,b**) is a step in the good direction, there is a joint need of ecosystem services (ES) provision maximization through biodiversity increase. From this issue stems the need to develop approaches that enable improved management of biodiversity in agricultural areas, reconciling farmers' economic requirements with sustained ecological functions.Fortunately, there already are (potential) conservation levers suited for agrosystems : At the local scale, the aforementioned implementation of floral strips and hedgerows constitutes a simple solution. However, the landscape scale, although less studied, has the potential to be more efficient on the long term.

<center>Figure 1 : 2023 estimates of all nine planetary boundaries <b>(from Richardson et al., 2023)</b></center>
<center>Six of the nine boundaries are transgressed. In addition, ocean acidification is approaching its planetary boundary. The green zone is the safe operating space (below the boundary). Yellow to red represents the zone of increasing risk. Purple indicates the high-risk zone where interglacial Earth system conditions are transgressed with high confidence. Values for control variables are normalized so that the origin represents mean Holocene conditions and the planetary boundary (lower end of zone of increasing risk, dotted circle) lies at the same radius for all boundaries (except for the wedges representing green and blue water, see main text). Wedge lengths are scaled logarithmically. The upper edges of the wedges for the novel entities and the genetic diversity component of the biosphere integrity boundaries are blurred either because the upper end of the zone of increasing risk has not yet been quantitatively defined (novel entities) or because the current value is known only with great uncertainty (loss of genetic diversity). Both, however, are well outside of the safe operating space. Transgression of these boundaries reflects unprecedented human disruption of Earth system but is associated with large scientific uncertainties

### Landscape (,) ecology

Landscape-scale research approach on biodiversity appears to be a promising approach because of its ability to take account of spatial variations in resources and  species pool for more precise and impactful management of biodiversity. Indeed, landscape greatly impacts biodiversity by constraining dispersion of organism or by its provision capacity in terms of resources (food) and habitat (shelter). 

In order to study this, we made use of landscape ecology, an ecology discipline that aims to take into account the spatial aspect of ecosystems to further our understanding of biodiversity. Landscape structure has been shown to strongly influence biodiversity especially through the heterogeneity of the landscape mosaic (i.e. pattern variations, spatial repartition of habitats or ressources of interest). Both : compositional and configurational heterogeneity (**F. Burel & J. Baudry, 2nd Ed, 2003**) can be described.  Compositional heterogeneity (types and proportions of landscape elements) : refers to the diversity and relative abundance of different land cover types, habitat patches, or ecosystem components within a landscape. This concept is central to understanding biodiversity patterns, as it influences species richness, community composition, and ecosystem processes. Fragmentation, the process of splitting and reducing the size of patches, often increases compositional heterogeneity by creating a mosaic of different land cover types (**F. Burel & J. Baudry, 2nd Ed, 2003**). Configurational heterogeneity (spatial arrangement and geometry of landscape element) : refers to the spatial arrangement, shape, size, and distribution of landscape elements, as well as their connectivity. It describes how patches of different land cover types are organized in space and how their configuration influences ecological processes such as species movement, gene flow, and resource availability. Connectivity is the functional linkage between habitat patches or landscape elements  and is notably determined by the structural arrangement of patches -e.g., their proximity, shape, distribution and presence of linear elements connecting them- (**F. Burel & J. Baudry, 2nd Ed, 2003**).

Although at first the two disciplines evolved independently, landscape ecology is related to the metacommunity theory (**Leibold et al., 2004**), itself derived from the metapopulation theory (**Hanski, 1991**) which appeared from the island biogeography theory (**MacArthur & Wilson, 1967**). A metacommunity can be defined as “a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species” : In the metacommunity theory, under the species-sorting paradigm, patch quality and spatial repartition are acknowledged to affect species dispersal, which is a key process in  biodiversity structuring at landscape level (**Leibold et al., 2004**).

Landscape ecology can function under a lot of different paradigm, although the classical one is the "landscape mosaic" paradigm (**Foreman, 1995**). This paradigm perceives the landscape as a collection of different habitats divided into patches. It also states that the entirety of the mosaic is relevant in ecological processes, and thus that the target habitat should not be considered alone (**Wiens JA, 1995**). While this paradigm does take into account the whole landscape, it still has a few shortcomings, the main one being that its description of the landscape mosaic is based on land-use. Land-use typologies are inherently anthropocentric, as their discrete categories are only dictated by the human perception of those land-use, which varies amongst different organisms (**F. Burel & J. Baudry, 2nd Ed, 2003**; **Dennis, Shreeve and Van Diek, 2003**; **Fahrig et al., 2011**). Relevant critics of this approach claim that the discrete (i.e. categorical) representation of environmental variables often distorts the true heterogeneity of the system and that "major discontinuities in underlying environmental variation are represented by discrete boundaries between plots [,] all other variation is subsumed within the plots and is either ignored or considered irrelevant" (**McGarigal & Cushman, 2005**).

In order to better account for the varying needs in resources and habitats of varying taxa, functional ecology might be a relevant avenue to explore. In this subdiscipline, biodiversity is understood as a set of functions, characterized using the concept of traits. Those functional traits are usually defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits impacting the fitness of the organism presenting those traits (**Violle et al., 2007**). Functional traits offer a mechanistic link between organisms and the resources they use, and have the potential to predict biodiversity patterns across spatial and temporal scales (**Liu et al., 2024**). Rather than relying on species, the functional trait approach describes how organisms interact with their environment, shape community assembly, and influence ecosystem functioning and services—including in agricultural or managed landscapes. Functional traits can be divided into to broad categories "response traits" and "effect traits": “response” traits, inform how species may respond to environmental changes, whereas "effect" traits inform how species will affect ecosystem functioning. Using functional traits as a whole could allow for a prospective approach to species distribution and dynamics, and thus to landscapes evolution too (**Kearney et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2024**). Under Hutchinson’s (non-functional) niche concept, the whole species’ tolerances and resource use are conceived as a multidimensional space, however with a trait-based approach, accuracy can be improved by explicitly linking traits to niche dimensions (**Violle & Jiang, 2009**). Incorporating regionally representative trait data -not currently possible with the completion state of trait databases- could enable landscape-level models that support functional landscape planning and biodiversity forecasting. This internship will mainly use effect traits to characterize habitat and resource provisioning for organisms of interest.

Hence arises the following question : could landscape ecology through the use of a functional lens allow for better understanding of biodiversity pattern ? The association of the two ecological disciplines to form "functional landscapes" would offer a wide range of possible approaches. This concept is not yet fully charted, although a few relevant articles can already be found, mainly for pollinators. 

Dennis 2003 → Perspective of what constitutes and how to define an habitat heavily impacts conservation efforts; Using only habitat patch view and metapop modelling would oversimplify reality and not allow to justify increasing landscape complexity to the stakeholders as not accounting for resources would make to much of an emphasis on biodiversity "reserves".

Dennis 2006 → call for resource-based approach of butterfly habitat and creation of database of species resource requirements.

Vanreusel 2007 → resource-based approach to butterfly habitat

Fahrig 2011 → set of patches that offer the same resources (considering the needs of all exemplar species) is then a functional cover type w/ types (dangerous, neutral, beneficial) 
"Cover type classification and mapping is based on species requirements, such as feeding and nesting, resulting in measures of '̂functional landscape heterogeneity'."
"We therefore make an important distinction between 'structural landscape heterogeneity', where different cover types are identified by their physical characteristics, without reference to a particular species or species group (e.g. using classified satellite imagery), and 'functional landscape heterogeneity' "
"concept behind functional landscape heterogeneity is that the description and measurement of heterogeneity should be based on the expected functions (e.g. provision of food, nesting sites, dispersal routes) provided by that heterogeneity to the species or species group(s) of interest."
"The simplest measure of compositional heterogeneity is the number of different cover types (cover type richness; Fig. 3). Then, given two landscapes with the same cover type richness, if a small number of cover types dominate the first landscape, while the cover types are of similar proportions in the second, the second landscape is more heterogeneous than the first (cover type evenness)." → can be combined into a shannon

"We suggest that the time is ripe for development of a landscapescale understanding of the relationship between landscape heterogeneity and biodiversity" 
"Developing these functional land cover maps will be an important challenge in conducting the proposed research." 
"However, more detailed landscape descriptions may not always yield more accurate predictions. To test this assumption, future studies should conduct replicate studies in different agricultural regions with different species pools"

Eckerter 2020 → "Wild bumblebees are key pollinators of crops and wild plants that rely on the continuous availability of floral resources. A better understanding of the spatio-temporal availability and use of floral food resources may help to promote bumblebees and their pollination services in agricultural landscapes." 
"Classical habitat maps predicted the colony development of B. terrestris better than detailed landscape-scale floral resource maps based on pollen use. This indicates that high amounts of attractive pollen food resources in the landscape alone are not sufficient to ensure a high fitness of bumblebee colonies. Still, the floral resource maps and diet analyses provided information that was not accessible only through classical habitat maps, e.g., that hedgerows play an overriding role in pollen availability to bumblebees in our study region despite their very small cover."
"Combining different mapping approaches might help to further disentangle complex relationships"
