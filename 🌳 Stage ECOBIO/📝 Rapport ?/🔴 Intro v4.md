Théorie métacommunauté : 
Métacommunauté = definition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view

easy to define local communities wherein species interact by affecting each other’s demographic rates  and a metacommunity as a set of local communities that exchange colonists of multiple species

“In this paper, we restrict ourselves only to metacommunity definitions that consider space implicitly and not explicitly (e.g. spatially explicit models where the location of individuals is tracked). We recognize, however, that there are some important phenomena that depend on spatially determined dynamics that our approach will consequently overlook.” (Leibold et al., 2004, p. 602)

Métapopulation = ensemble de sous pop interconnectées par individus qui se dispersent (Hanski, 1991 Patch-occupancy dynamics in fragmented landscapes, TREE 9 p131-135)
=> postulat/constat "l'espace est fragmenté en habitats distincts, favorables ou défavorable à l'installation d'une espèce"


# Introduction

Since a few decades, Earth's biosphere has been steadily degrading, mostly due to anthropic activities. In 2023, was published an updated estimation of Earth's boundaries, that stated that 6 out of the 9 critical boundaries were already transgressed, thus "suggesting that Earth is now well outside of the safe operating space for humanity" (Richardson et al., 2023). Those 9 boundaries and their respective states can be found in **figure 1**.
