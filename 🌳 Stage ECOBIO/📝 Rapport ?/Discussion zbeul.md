Land-use typologies are inherently anthropocentric, as their discrete categories are only dictated by the human perception of those land-use, which varies amongst different organisms (Burel & Baudry, 2003; Dennis, Shreeve and Van Diek, 2003; Fahrig et al., 2011). Although still employing anthropocentric discrete land-use typologies, a 2011 paper distinguished between "structural" and "functional" landscape heterogeneity, and created functional cover typologies, associating these covers with a suitability index varying for different taxa ("dangerous", "neutral", "beneficial") accounting for the ecological functions (e.g., food provision, nesting, dispersal) that they elements offer to focal species (Fahrig et al., 2011).
