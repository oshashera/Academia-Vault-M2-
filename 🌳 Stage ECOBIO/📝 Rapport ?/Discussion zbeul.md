Land-use typologies are inherently anthropocentric, as their discrete categories are only dictated by the human perception of those land-use, which varies amongst different organisms (Burel & Baudry, 2003; Dennis, Shreeve and Van Diek, 2003; Fahrig et al., 2011). Although still employing anthropocentric discrete land-use typologies, a 2011 paper distinguished between "structural" and "functional" landscape heterogeneity, and created functional cover typologies, associating these covers with a suitability index varying for different taxa ("dangerous", "neutral", "beneficial") accounting for the ecological functions (e.g., food provision, nesting, dispersal) that they elements offer to focal species (Fahrig et al., 2011).

One of the risks we run here is that the land-use typology used may homogenize plant communities too much (i.e. coniferous or deciduous forests are very different, if only in terms of leaf traits, yet the final species list merges these two land-uses into a single one called “forest” and contains no conifers species).
