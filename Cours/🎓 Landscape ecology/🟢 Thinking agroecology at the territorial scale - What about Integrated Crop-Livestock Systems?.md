### I] Integrated Crop Livestock Systems beyond farm level: some concepts

#### The context: Territorial specialization of the agricultural production
![[Pasted image 20241105085854.png|center|550]]
#### The context: A decline of mixed crop-livestock farms
![[Pasted image 20241105085934.png|center|750]]
**Mixed crop-livestock farm** = combining livestock and cash crops at farm level
**Specialized farm** = one activity accounts for more than 2/3 of the standard output of a farm

#### (Re)-thinking crop-livestock integration at the territorial scale
##### Mixed Crop-Livestock Systems : Importance of the spatial and temporal interactions between the ecological components (Moraine et al., 2012)
![[Pasted image 20241105090145.png|center|300]]

##### Mixed Crop-Livestock Systems : Two scales for the interactions
![[Pasted image 20241105090246.png|center|550]]
##### Integrated Crop-Livestock Systems beyond farm scale : different types of organizations (Martin et al., 2016)
![[Pasted image 20241105090350.png|center|750]]
>[!tldr] For all types of organizations
>Territory = The geographical scale at which the interactions between farmers and relied stakeholders are organized, ultimately shaping the land-use and the socio-economic activities


### II]Application to the Minervois region (South of France): example of two types of organizations

#### Case study : ICLS beyond farm scale in the Minervois region

#### 1. Exchanges between cereal growers and livestock breeder

> [!faq] Cereal growers problematic
> Most farmers are under organic certification, they developed a rotation based on legumes toensure soil fertility.
>![[Pasted image 20241105090836.png]]
>BUT the 1st harvest in alfalfa and sainfoin is not valuable as grain legume because of the weeds.

>[!faq] Livestock breeder problematic
>The livestock breeders work together on ways to gain in feeding and economic autonomy.
>BUT they still face forage shortage, especially during hot summers. 

![[Pasted image 20241105091040.png|center|600]]

>[!faq] Benefits for cereal growers
>1. Value the 1st harvest of legume crops without additional management and supports their cereal rotation
>2. Access CAP subsidies

>[!warning] However, some trade-offs
>Unpredictability of the timing of the harvest performed by the livestock breeders
Compromises regarding harvest timing: the latter the breeders come, the less the yields for the 2nd harvest

>[!faq] Benefits for livestock breeders
>1. Additional forage stocks
>2. Discuss/Check the quality of the forage with the cereal breeders

>[!warning] However, some trade-offs
>Economic benefits are only observed during years with high forage prices
→ Costs: gasoline, machineries 
Time consuming and tiering

>[!important] So conflicts between cereal farmers and livestock breeders may appear !

>[!question] How to overcome conflicts and make this ICLS beyond farm level last ? (group exercise)

>[!warning] Issues
>Livestock breeders
>- Time and cost to work the cereal grower fields
>- Quality of the forage (if too full of unwanted weeds)
>- Not enough forage for all livestock ?
>- Sanitary problems due to sick crops ?
>Cereal growers
>- impact on 2nd harvest
>- dependance on breeders
>- storage capacity if not sold immediately
>- define timeline between the breeders and cereal growers
>- plein de trucs

> [!done] Solution
> Livestock breeders
>- Use grower machinery and just pay for fuel
>Cereal
>- do harvest and sell it to breeders with discussion about prices beforehand
>- financial compensation by breeders if late to timeline ?
>- plein de trucs

#### 2. Exchanges between landless shepherds, winegrowers and cereal growers
![[Pasted image 20241105094644.png|center|650]]
##### Integrated sheep-vineyard systems (vitipastoralisme): Back to the future ? 

A practice historically present in the South of France: Landless shepherds were used to graze their flocks in the mountains in the summer (transhumance) and in the plains in the winter (transhumance inverse)
→ A practice nearly lost with the industrialization of the agriculture that is regaining attention for its multiple benefits

##### Multiple agronomic benefits for the vineyards : Increased soil fertility
![[Pasted image 20241105094837.png|right|330]]

\+ Soil organic matter
\+ Microbial biomass and diversity
\+ Stable organic N
\+ available P
\+ Residue turnover rates

*(Brewer et al., 2023)*

No impact on soil compaction if well managed

**BUT** higher risks for N losses

##### Multiple agronomic benefits for the vineyards : Maintenance of the floral biodiversity
![[Pasted image 20241105094933.png|center|550]]
##### Multiple agronomic benefits for the vineyards : Diminution of the number of interventions

1.3 times less herbicide application
2.2 times less mechanical intervention for weed management

##### But some barriers : a complex management

• Possible damage to the wines → graze during the right period, vine protections
• Possible damages to the irrigation systems in the vineyards → aerial or buried
• Conflicts between dates of grazing and operational activities in the plots
• Water for the sheeps → find plots with an access to water or bring water tanks
• Herd displacement → by foot or by truck?
• Adaptation to the weather conditions : no grazing in vineyards when rain →having uncultivated areas next to the vineyards “just in case”

**=>A complex herd management that requires a strong coordination between sherpherds and winegrowers**

### III] Beyond agronomical benefits, advantages for the territories

#### What benefits for territories ? - ICLS beyond farm level: benefits for territories
![[Pasted image 20241107113521.png|right|300]]
**A quick case study on fire management**

• Huge fire in 2019
• Roundtable to find ways to manage the fire risk:

→ Local representatives
→ Fire department
→ ONF
→ Chambre d’agriculture
→ Researchers

Found solution: Reintroducing sheep grazing on uncultivated land that are defined by the ONF and the fire department

#### ICLS beyond farm level: but still some fears
![[pastedimage117241139(1).png|center|400]]

→How to coordinate several activities on one territory that already face issues and make the ICLS beyond farm scale last

- @ Producing activities: viticulture, cereals, livestock, forestry, industries… 
- @ “Services” activities: school, security and well-being of the inhabitants…
- @ Recreational activities: hunting, tourisms…
- @ Conservation and preservation: protected area, regulations…

- ? Lack of resources: water, feeding resources for sheeps
- ? Conflicts between the stakeholders : shepherds, hunters, winegrowers, cereal growers, elected representatives, inhabitants…
- ? Context of land abandonment
- ? Lack of outlet

### IV] How to accompany the development and maintenance of ICLS beyond farm scale?

#### Development and maintenance of ICLS: key stakeholders

#### Maintenance and development of ICLS: tools

### Take home messages

![[Pasted image 20241107114900.png|right|750]]

ICLS beyond farm scale are opportunities for an agroecological development of territories

• Agronomic benefits

• Benefits for the management of territories

• Socio-economic benefits
