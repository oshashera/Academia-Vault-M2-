###### Goals of the course unit
- Understand the concept of landscape and its uses with different disciplinary perspectives
- Describe an agricultural landscape
- Know several underlying concepts

##### Question : What is your definition of a landscape ?

<u>Students answers :</u> 
- the aspect of a territory : what you can see
- background

#### 1. Definitions of landscape

- Wikipedia : "all the visible features of an area of land"

- Forman & Godron (1981) : "A landscape is a heterogeneous land area composed of a cluster of interacting ecosystems that is repeated in similar forms" => ecology definition

- European Convention on Landscape (2000) : "A landscape is an area as perceived by people, whose character is the result of the action and interaction of natural and/or human factors"

##### Goals of the lecture 
- Identify agronomic challenges that occur at landscape scale
- Know different methods and tools to understand and address these challenges
- Understand the multidisciplinary nature of landscapes and its interactions with farm activities

## I] Concepts and challenges at landscape scale

#### Agronomy and landscape

The landscape scale is constitutive of agronomy : 
- "The basis of agriculture is the knowledge of the natural dimension of the **terroirs** that we want to cultivate" (O. de Serres, 1600)
- Agronomy : "A science of action, a technology and an ecology applied to the production of crops **and to the planning of agricultural landscapes**" (S. Hénin, 1967)

#### A little bit of history

- Before 1950 : Agronomy very linked to geography, a sort of regional crop science related to the knowledge of local climate, soil and history
- 1950-1980 : abstraction of the landscape, studies more focused on plot and field scales, to understand and manage yield variations (productivism), growing importance of food chain approaches, good control of local variability by the use of chemical inputs
- Since 1980's : come-back of the landscape, better consideration of environmental challenges and environment capacities
	- New tools : computers, GIS, GPS, remote sensing, modeling
	- More multidisciplinarity : soil science, bioclimatology, ecology, statistics

Between socio-economic and cultural drivers 

AND

Natural and structural drivers

#### 1.1. Definition of landscape agronomy

Sub-discipline of agronomy which studies, in space and time :
- The **management methods** of farming activities (crops, animals, semi-natural areas...)
- The **consequences** of these management methods on the landscape features (biomass production, CNP cycles, water flows,...)
- The way these consequences **affect the goals** (various and sometimes contradictory) of landscape stakeholders
- The **modification of management methods** to better answer the goals of stakeholders (design/assessment)

U don't propose the same things for farmers in different agronomic units

##### Question : What are important agronomic challenges at landscape / regional scale ? 

#### 1.2 Agricultural challengers at landscape/regional scale

- Economic: 
	- Agricultural production
	- Agricultural chain (colleciton areas, expectations of agrifood sector)
- Social
	- Food supply, food self-sufficiency
	- Employment in agriculture and related activities
	- Landscape as aesthetic and cultural living environment
	- Productions linked to a "terroir" (PGI, PDO (aop))
- Environnemental
	- Water quality and quantity
	- Biodiversity (agricultural and semi-natural)
	- GHG and climate change

#### 1.2 Economic challengers

#### 1.2 Environmental challenges

##### Which actors are needed to answer challenges at landscape scale ? 
- Farmers
- Policymakers
- Farm counselors
- Agrifood chain actors


#### 1.2 Different scales, challenges, actors
[graph]


#### 1.2 Short exercise

Answer individually these questions (2min of thinking)
1) At which scale (plant/animal, farm, landscape) is scientific knowledge more developed
I'd say organism ✅
2) At which scale are most impacts (positive and negative) of farming activities observed
I'd say landscape ? ✅
3) At which scale is action easier to reduce adverse impacts and enhance positive impacts of farming ?
I'd say farm ? ✅

#### 1.2 Scales of knowledge, impact, action

#### Example 1

#### 2.1 Context : evolution of farming systems

- North of Aube department is specialized in crop production : cereals (wheat/barley), oilseed rape, potato, sugar beet, alfalfa
- Important consumption of fertilizers and pesticides has a significant impact on the environment
- Interest for an evolution of farming systems
- Almost no livestock anymore
- Growing interest in biogas production
=> How to assess possible future scenarios on environmental aspects ?

#### 2.1 Life cycle assessment at territory scale

- Life cycle assessment is a trusted multicriteria analysis tool
- Usually used for a product
- Development of a methodology to use it at regional scale : farm typologies, farmers surveys + public databases and expert knowledge
- Aggregation of all production methods for all main crops and livestock activities of the territory
- Scenario analysis

#### 2.1 Territorial LCA perimeter
[graph]

#### 2.1 environmental profile of territory
[graph]

#### 2.1 Scenario analysis

- Scenarios conceived with farmers and local advisors
- 40 biogas plants vs introduction of 10k sheeps
- [graph]
- No significant effect of any of the scenarios (uncertainty ~10%)

#### 2.1 Use of results

- The territorial LCA method allows for environmental assessment of agricultural activities of a small region and scenario analysis
BUT
- relies on many hypotheses due to important data needs
- is a complex method, not transferable to local actors
=> Need for better local data sources and a more user-friendly assessment tool

#### Example 2 - Participative conception and evaluation of scenarios to manage phoma on oilseed rape

#### 2.2 Context on phoma

- Oilseed rape : ~5% of French agricultural area
- Very important crop in cereal-based rotations

- Oilseed rape Phoma (*Leptosphaeria maculans*) : fungus that can cause 5 to 20% losses
- Some cultivars have genes of resistance (RlmX) : the best prevention method available
- Risk of resistance breakage by fungus
=> Collective strategies need to preserve resistance as long as possible

#### 2.2 A landscape model for phoma

#### 2.2 Use in a farming landscape
[graph]

#### 2.2 Short exercise

With your neighbour, answer to this question
How would you conceive a participative approach using this model ? Describe the different steps plan ?
Stakeholder into interview/discussion into common approach and goals into model ?

#### 2.2 Participative modeling of scenarios
hossard et al 2013![[Pasted image 20241104114538.png|center|350]]

#### 2.2 Selection of adapted scenarios

[graph]
Isolation of resistant cultivar RlmX
- Modeling and concertation with stakeholders allows to propose solutions to prevent resistance breakage
But
- Hard to coordinate farmers
- Others actors not participating (counselors, farm cooperatives, breeding)
