A lot into ecology and environmental sciences 
Redfield ratio in aquatic ecosystems : ratio of **106C: 16N: 1P** always the same ratio on the planet.

>[!important] One challenge that all organisms face is the acquisition of sufficient quantities of energy and elements needed for growth, reproduction and maintenance.

Faim d'azote when lot of carbon but few nitrogen => lack of nitrogen to degrade carbon 

## I] What is ecological stoechiometry ?

- Chemical stoechiometry is a very large set of constraints that limit the combination of chemical elements and how they interact together (mass action law, reactionnal quotient, thermodynamic laws)
- Stoechiometry refers to conservation of atomic species
- By analogy, ecological stoechiometry set <u>limits</u> to **biological interacting systems using elemental ratios**

Example 1 :

Beetle has more Cu or Na than plants for ex, and need its ratio

=> it will shit the ratio of the ressources with the help of symbionts, or can use another strategy (more costly), to adapt its physiology (increasing its respiration to release more C for example).

- constraints on growth and reproduction
⬇
- alter the dynamics of populations
⬇
- inter-specific interactions in food webs
⬇
- **key processes in ecosystems**

ecological flexibility adjust to different elemental balances

Physiological capacity to accumulate and store elements in excess of their immediate needs, to adjust allocation towards the synthesis of more C- or nutrient-rich compounds, and to alter growth form towards defense, storage and structural tissues
![[Pasted image 20241108125857.png|center]]
- Primary producers tends to be more stoechiometrically flexible than their consumers
- Plant can regulate the tissue composition (root, stem, leaves)
- Nutrient resorption capacity (senescing leaves, litter to green leaves,...)

### 2. Examples

#### Example 1 :

• Limiting elements are expected to be utilized for growth and transferred in food chains with high efficiency, 

• Non-limiting elements, by definition present in excess, must be **disposed and recycled** --->

##### Soil organic matter decomposition (particularly unprotected SOM) is often rate-limited by microbial metabolism

#### Example 2 :
![[Pasted image 20241108131320.png|right|550]]

###### CO2 fertilization of vegetation

An increase in plant growth under elevated CO2 causes N to accumulate in litter and plant biomass **BUT** soil N availability is expected to limit plant growth under elevated CO2 in the long term without the addition of exogenous nitrogen
<br>
###### P addition

P additions on terrestrial ecosystem C:N:P stoichiometry (a) and ecosystem functions (b).

###### Biogeochemical cycles

Short-term inputs of resources (usually associated with anthropogenic or ‘natural’ disturbances) facilitate colonization by **relaxing resource limitation**

**Fluctuating resource availability theory**

## III] Ecological stoechiometry and landscape : meta ecosystem theory

-  Water acts as a solvent, carrier, catalyst and reagent in many ecosystem reactions and processes. The flux of nutrients into and through many terrestrial ecosystems is largely dependent on the amount and temporal distribution of rain and snow and the chemical content of this water.

-  Hydrologic cycle assumes paramount importance through its effect on all other biogeochemical cycles; e.g. by regulating **the timing and amount of inputs of chemicals in precipitation, and loss of dissolved and particulate substances by erosion, in runoff, or controlling biological activities.**

-  In turn, transpiration by plants affects the hydrologic cycle, thereby reducing the loss of nutrients from a drainage area.

>[!faq] The right-angle shape derives from Liebig's law of the minimum, that growth is limited by the nutrient in shortest supply relative to demand.

In general, biogeochemical processes vary in rate and relative importance across the landscape and this heterogeneity is a consequence of material movement and mixing.

- Hot spots occur when and where resources mix to create optimal ratios that support high biogeochemical activity, either at boundaries or specific locations within ecosystems.

-  Small catchments represent well-defined landscape units with respect to their boundaries, and they are ideal for conducting insightful investigations into the patterns and soil C, N, and P status and the associated stoichiometry

-  Such work can clearly reflect the impacts on the environment (e.g. the extents of N and P richness) and global climate change (through C sequestration) from agriculture systems

### Stoechiometry: conclusions

![[Pasted image 20241108132401.png|left|450]] Ecological stoechiometry is a new area of ecology used to understand how
nutrient cycles are affected
<br>

Ecological Stoichiometry was even shown to have societal relevance by
application in agriculture, wastewater treatment and assessing ecosystem
services. Landscape management, trough agriculture, hydrological cycles
can modify C:N:P:X ratios
<br>

One important challenge worth emphasizing here is the development of
rigorous numerical approaches to assess the influence of configuration and
ecosystem interactions in complex landscapes on ecosystem stoichiometry
