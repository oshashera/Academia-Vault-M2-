## I] Why is this teaching unit in your curricula ?

##### How can we feed without overwhelming our planet ?

Nowadays, some of the most fertile soils are found in the most densely populated areas on the planet
=> Incredible pressure on soils
If we want to increase production we'll have bad quality soil => inputs or redesign agrosystems

- A food gap : need 7400 trillions of calories (56% 2010)
- A land gap : we need 593 mHa (twice the size of India)
- A GHG gap : we need 15 Gt (2010) to 4 Gt to keep below 2Â°C global warming
- A resource gap : finite ressources, biodiversity, soil as a resource (non-renewable (= not renewable on a human timescale))

##### Tech based approach ?

Some are efficient, environmentally friendly and adapted to end-users, but some are : 
- Violating the rights of communities to dictate their own future
- Fallacy of neutrality of some technologies
- Reluctance of society to some technologies (i.e. GMOs in EU)
- Reinforcement of inequalities
- Increase corporate control over farm decision-making
- Animal well fare, energy costs, ethical concern of data ownership
- Not mature enough to cope with immediate needs

##### Or nature-based ? With nature, not against

Need a lot of scientific inputs.
Territorial/landscape approach, associations,...
Perhaps a need to use new techs to monitor/study those possibilities

##### But rely on plant-soil interactions (=above/belowground interactions)

But more COMPLEX
1. To design
2. To manage
3. Holistic perspective
4. Contexte dependency

##### Managing above-belowground interactions for agro-ecosystems productivity

- Interactions between aboveground and belowground organisms are important drivers of plant growth and performance in natural ecosystems.
- Making practical use of such above-belowground biotic interactions offers important opportunities for enhancing the sustainability of agriculture
- The operation of above- and belowground organisms at different spatial and temporal scales provides important challenges for application in agriculture.

Chemical, biological (e.g. fungi, nematods, etc), physical properties.
With soil legacy, we've got to have a long-term approach

##### And other ecosystems functions !

By modeling precipitation / temperature => from 69 trees species in Europe to 9 estimated in 2090 
What varieties will we use in the future ?

##### Climate change and extreme weather events will set the clock

*Corero I 2023 : High intensity perturbations induce an abrupt shift in soil microbial state*

How we are shifting is a question of recurrence and intensity of perturbation.
Exemple : effect of tillage depth

## II] Soil sciences for managing nutrient : is that all we need for cropping system design ?

##### NO !
![[Pasted image 20241007103229.png|center]]
Focal point about soil biodiv
Soil biodiv is under pressure bc of climate change and poor land management => loss of ecosystem functioning and service provision

##### Soil type, land-use and soil functions

When complexity too important, conceptualizing is primordial
##### Several concepts for one aim : preserving soils and related ecosystem services

![[Pasted image 20241007103807.png|center]]
*Lehman 2020 the concept and future prospects of soil health*

Soi fertility : related to production, less used today, we use soil quality and soil health today
Soil security will be developed later (and qualitative assessment because more social

>[!element] Indicator :
>Variable that can give you information about more complexe variables (=proxy)

##### Soil quality : inherent and dynamic components

Inherent soil quality is related to pedogenesis, estimated over the whole soil profile
Dynamic soil quality, related to agricultural practices, estimated on the superficial layer (0-20), where the most of biological activity and agricultural impacts.

##### Soil quality : inherent (pedogenesis)

##### Soil quality and adaptative management

![[Pasted image 20241010161159.png|center|500]]
- re-active to observed deterioration of soil functioning
- pro-active to reach transitions to newly desired soil functioning.
- soil quality assessment plays a role in decision-making in the face of soil threats

##### Indicators to monitor soil quality 

![[Pasted image 20241010161253.png|center|600]]

##### Indicators to monitor soil quality

To be used as a indicator
-  relevant to soil quality (health), its ecosystem functions and services
- sensitive, by changing detectably and quickly without being reflective of merely short-term oscillations;
- practical, by being conducted cheaply and with a short turnaround time;
- and informative for management


â€¢ **there is a multitude of soil-health/quality indicators**
![[Pasted image 20241007105336.png]]


##### Capture the complexity of soil functioning

- Minimal dataset
- Indicators transformation into combinable scores
- Integration of transformed indicators into indices
![[Pasted image 20241010161452.png|center|400]]

##### Indicators to monitor soil quality

![[Pasted image 20241010161531.png|center|500]]
What is the soil threat ?
What is it's relation to soil function ?
Then we use indicators into index of soil health

##### Capture the complexity of soil functioning 

##### Evolution of the main objectives : multi-functionality, resilience and resistance 
![[Pasted image 20241010161621.png]]
**Case study: soil organic matter**
- changes in response to management and land use are difficult to detect since the total pool is large.
- total soil organic matter is ubiquitous in soil quality assessment
- Pools of soil organic matter such as labile or active carbon are typically more sensitive to disturbance than total soil organic matter and can give a better indication about soil processes

##### Evolution of the main objectives : multi-functionality, resilience&resistance

![[Pasted image 20241010161757.png|900]]
Emerging trend to integrate resilience and resistance
##### Heuristic concept of panarchy : nested hierarchical system

##### And manage the trade-offs between functions
