## The case for temperate semiarid and arid agricultural land

## I] What is soil organic matter ?

>[!tldr] Soil organic matter
>Soil organic matter is a **complex biogeochemical mixture** derived from organic material in **all stages of decomposition**, with **plant litter** compounds remaining in the soil for periods **ranging from a few days to decades**.

 Intensity & speed varies from place to place
Highest topsoil organic C => northern uk, and scandinavian countries
Lowest => spain, south of Europe
Relation to temperature and precipitations 


Soil organic matter is, in general, **a minor component of soil**
However, it is a key component in terms of soil functioning :

## II] Soil organic matter cycling 

![[Pasted image 20241010165727.png|center|600]]

Used in metabolism, energy is used for growing, but mineralization 
Microorganism activity happens in the soil matrix.
Minerals can have different sizes,etc... => soil physics (texture, mineralogy, moisture)
2 types of organic matter, of which mineral associated OM is the harder one to exploit (is at the end of the cycle) (à droite du diapo)
Depending to what we have we might add organic matter into different phase of the cycle

>[!tldr] Classic "humification" 
>Relie on the synthesis of large molecules from decomposition products

>[!tldr] Selective preservation
>Assumes that some organic materials are preferentially mineralized leaving intrinscially stable decompotion products behind

>[!tldr] Progressive decomposition
Reflects the concepts of microbial processing of large plant biopolymers to smaller molecules 

Plant residues decomposed into big -> small polymers then put into bigger molecules ("classic humification" theory)
Selective preservation = not every type of OM can be mineralized the same

All debated but all true

##### What relationship with the study of SOM ?

## III] Assessing soil organic matter in soils

The AMOUNT of organic matter incorporated into the soil depends on :

![[Pasted image 20241008095953.png|center|400]]
A simplification for the estimation of these amounts is considering coefficients that regulate the two most
significant **FLUXES**
- Isohumic or humification coefficient (**k1**) (% incorporated from inputs)
- Mineralization coefficient (**k2**) (%mineralized <u>from new inputs and old SOC</u>)

## IV] Case study : semiarid and arid agricultural land

The case for temperate semiarid and arid agricultural land
- Particular conditions for SOC dynamics
	- Climate, soil types
- The challenges of agricultural management
	- The case for irrigation
- Soil inorganic C: trade-offs with SOC

##### What are the conditions in relation to SOC?

>[!tldr] SUMMARY
>- Soil organic matter (SOM) is at the heart of soil functioning, as it explains most of the soil chemical and physical fertility. SOM is at present understood as a continuum in the soil, in which progressive decomposition leads to less complex community from large plant and animal residues towards smaller molecular size, and more oxidized forms.
>- Studying organic matter dynamics needs to account for soil and climate conditions, and the interaction of soil management with them.
>- In many semiarid soils, mineral properties and management conditions interfere with organic matter cycling.
>- Adequate SOM assessment needs knowledge on its cycling, and adaptation to the particular conditions of the (agro)ecosystem considered.

##### Soil inorganic C: Trade-offs with SOC

###### Evidence of SOC-SIC interactions

#### Interaction of SIC with soil management
![[Pasted image 20241011101127.png|center|600]]

**Long-term consequences**
As a result, SIC can be lost or gained at different paces.
CONSEQUENCES:
- <u>Direct:</u>
	- SIC loss in intensely fertilized soils
	- GHG emissions
- <u>Indirect:</u>
	- Deprotection/protection of SOM
	- Changes in the soil fabric
	- Changes in riverine alcalinity
