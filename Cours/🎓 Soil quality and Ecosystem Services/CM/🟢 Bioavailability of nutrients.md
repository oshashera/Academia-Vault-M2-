## I] The biogeochemical cycles
#### A glance to the biogeochemical cycle
![[Pasted image 20241015115512.png|center|350]]
No gaseous form of P (to remember)
What is interesting for K, only mineral forms and mostly related to potassium ions

#### Nitrogen cycle 
![[Pasted image 20241015115549.png|center|480]]
Ammonium and nitrate are the main form absorbed by plants, but to have them we need OM degradation, which is related to mostly fungal and bacterial enzymes. Bacteria and fungi also play a big role in nitrification.
Cost of nitrate absorption cuz transformed into ammonium

#### Phosphorus cycle
![[Pasted image 20241015115646.png|center|480]]
Only **phosphate ions** (3 types) constitute the form absorbable by plants.
(1-10 µMol concentration)
The dynamic of the processes that refill the P in the soil are very important

##### Potassium cycle
![[Pasted image 20241015115804.png|center|480]]
No organic forms
- **K uptake is closely linked to water economy**
- Low affinity
- High affinity transporter

#### K in a drier world

###### K and plant alien success

###### K and N deposition

###### K and organic production is an issue

## II] Tools for managing nutrients
#### Environmental vs bio availability
![[Pasted image 20241015120453.png|center|450]]
An element is limiting for growth because the supply rate (pool of element) from soil is low or / and transport rate is restricted by :
- Water content
- Soil structure
- Temperature
- Root architecture
- ...

##### Rhizosphere
![[Pasted image 20241015121508.png|center|400]]
- Rhizosphere functioning is shaped by the combined influence of host genotype (G), soil environment as affected by agroecosystem management and inherent soil characteristics (E), and their interaction (G × E).
#### Environmental vs bio availability
![[Pasted image 20241015121705.png|center|450]]
Environmental availability is related and depends and soil-solution interactions, very slow processes, defines the potentially available concentration

## III] Rhizosphere and nutrition

#### Rhizosphere

- cation-anion balance uptake

- rhizosphere pH

#### Rhizosphere functioning

#### Rhizosphere effects from lab to field
![[Pasted image 20241015123044.png|center|250]]
- Spatio-temporal gradients
- Sampling and methods
- Different factors influencing rhizosphere
![[Pasted image 20241015123139.png|center|300]]
Knowledge from lab/models into field to have indicators and actionnable knowledge

Measure rhizosphere effect on farmer's field inspired by the soil health framework

Measure Rhizosphere effect on farmer’s field inspired by the soil health framework
• Minimum dataset
• Easy to determine
• Baseline
• Interpretable to guide farmers

#### The plan-soil interplay : emergent properties from the rhizosphere pathway
![[Pasted image 20241015141654.png|center|200]]
- Diversification (crop diversity index)
![[Pasted image 20241015141715.png|center|300]]
- Diversification x Soil management

#### Plant trait based approach to improve nitrogen cycling in agroecosystems
![[Pasted image 20241015141808.png|center|800]]

- Phosphorus
- Breeding programs

![[Pasted image 20241015142224.png|center|700]]![[Pasted image 20241015142328.png|center|500]]
#### What about other solutions ?

- Inoculation (biofertilizers) is efficient in controlled, greenhouse conditions **BUT** most of them are **NOT** in natural conditions

- Compatibility (crop host, soil type, agricultural practices)
- ![[Pasted image 20241015142646.png|center|550]]
#### Bet on plant abilities ?
