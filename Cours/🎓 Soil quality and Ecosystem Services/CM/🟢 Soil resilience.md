##### Evolution of the main objectifs : multifunctionality, resistance & resilience

How can we define soil resistance and resilience indicators so that we can maintain those properties under stress and perturbation

##### Resistance and resilience are two facets of ecological stability

Biodiversity low, then processes resistance and resilience are weakened

##### Soils are faced to several man-made and natural stress factors.

- press disturbance will last for a certain period of time
- pulse disturbance from a single event results in prompt changes

Disturbance is defined as an even that affect ecosystem services and community or population structures and changes resources substrates availability or physical environment

##### Climate change : pulse and press

- precipitation regime
- storms
- very difficult to predict

How do we design experiments if we don't know how to predicts future conditions ?


Temperature is predicted to increase during this century and extreme values as high as 53.7Â°C have been rated on Earth in 2017

- A small increase in temperature may foster biological activity
- Global R<sub>s</sub> was rising during 1987-2016
- Great differences among biomes

- A small increase in temperature may foster biological activity : **soil C loss ?**
- Rs is comprised of heterotrophic respiration (Rh) of microbes and autotrophic respiration (Rs) of plant roots and associated **rhizosphere** microbes

1. conflicting results from single-site studies by capturing global patterns in a warmer world
2. the slowdown of global Rs rise is very likely to be resuscitated since global [diapo]

â€¢ **A small increase temperature may foster biological activity**
- The temperature dependence of biological activity is expected to follow an Arrhenius model
- But more subtile equation (quadratic models) for some processes

- Nitrification NH4+ to NO3-

- A small increase temperature may foster biological activity
- More intense rain storms may involve flooding (few studies)

- Severe drought

>[!element] Key message 1
>Soils need to be resilient to deliver the functions required of them when subjected to perturbations within the context of short- and long-term environmental change

##### Agricultural practices

Land use
Land use intensity
Soil,water and management practices
Crop densities, crop functional traits

## II] Soil resilience

##### Soil resilience is specific to each soil and depends on interactions

- intrinsic factors are those soil properties that are fundamental to soil, such as texture, organic matter content and biological characteristics
- Extrinsic factors are those that relate to the soil as it occurs in th landscape

![[Pasted image 20241010164355.png|center|400]]

##### Common soil resilience indicator

![[Pasted image 20241010164425.png|center|400]]

- Orwin and Wardle indices (widely used for soil respiration)
- Other indicators (ex. nitrification)

##### Our understanding ?

![[Pasted image 20241010164521.png|center|500]]
- Only indicators...

>[!element] Key message 2
> No norms are available to determine the soil resistance and resilience

>[!element] Key message 3
>Emerging topic, so our understanding is poor, especially for combined stress (additive, synergistic,...)

**Resilience has to be considered as an emerging property (something you can't predict from analysis ?)**
