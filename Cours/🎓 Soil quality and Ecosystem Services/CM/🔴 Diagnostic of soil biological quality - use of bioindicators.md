## Introduction 
## I] Définitions (soil biological quality, bioindicators/biomarkers)

The soil biological quality refers to the **abundance, diversity and activity** of living organisms that contribute to the soil functions (chaussod, 1995)

From an agronomical point of view, the biological quality of soils can be defined by four major components
1) **Fertility**, which relates to the way the numerous soil µorg involved in biogeochemical cycles or in root symbiotic associations meet the plants requirements
2) **Sanitary conditions**, including populations of crop pests, pathogens and weeds
3) **Outputs** (externalities) = the environmental impacts of the soil system functioning on surface and underground waters and on the surrounding atmosphere.
4) **Resilience** in terms of withstanding (resistance) to perturbation and returning to initial conditions

#### Why do we need bioindicators ?
♦ Increasing degradation of soil
♦Tools for soil quality assessment

#### Bioindicators and biomarkers

###### <u>Bioindicators</u>:
**Organism** (or part of an organism or community of organisms) which indicates by its presence or absence and its behaviour, the state and functioning of an ecosystem

###### <u>Biomarkers</u>:
Any biological response to an environmental chemical at the below individual level, measured inside an organism or in its products (urine, faeces, hairs, feathers, etc...)
Term restricted to biochemical, physiological, histological and morphological (including appearance, pigmentation, surface deformation etc...) measurements of "health " and exclude behavioural effets
 
 
## II] Why do we need bioindicators ?

#### Interest regarding chemical analysis ?

Exemple from Bioindicator program
Thill Site « impact od reduced tillage on soil »

Which indicators are used at european scale ?





## III] Which tools are available to assess soil biological quality

### Wheight and diversity of soil organisms (reminder)

### WHich tools are available ?


## IV] How these tools can be carried on in field and laboratory ?


## V]How can we intepretet the results

minimum 10 meters away from the edges to not have their effect
also avoid tractors / animals entrances / paths
