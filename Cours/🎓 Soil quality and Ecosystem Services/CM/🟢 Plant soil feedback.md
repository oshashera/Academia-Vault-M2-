Plant biodiversity promotes sustainable agriculture directly and via belowground effects
![[Pasted image 20241007094458.png]]
Yes but : 
- Climate change (temperature, pCO<sub>2</sub>, extreme weather events) modify the plant legacies on soil microbiome
- Slow responses and legacies effects are note integrated in cropping system design
- Diversification either spatial or temporal in specialized farmland face socio-technical lock-ins, self reinforcement and blind crop breeding programs
- Actionability of knowledge requires active engagement by ecologists, land-use planners and nature managers

### In consequence, navigating among theoritical concepts & methodology is essential.

## I] Introduction

###### From ecology to soil sciences

- Legacy is intimately close to the notion of **ecological heritage** defined by evolutive ecology
- Effects of one event on (a)biotic characteristics of an ecosystem that last after disappearance of the causal event
	- Exemple : "land use legacy" on soil structure, drought legacy effect on soil communities
- The term "legacy effect" has been used in ecology since the early 1990s by authors studying plant succession, invasive plant impacts, herbivory impacts, ecosystem engineering, and human land-use impact.

<center>In particular, legacy effects could refer to those kinds of ecological inheritance where a physical or biological
change in ecosystem state is caused by one species, where this change persists after the extirpation of the causal
species and alters selection pressure of another species much later in time.

Plants can alter the abiotic and biotic components of the soil ecosystem and this can result in soil legacies that **facilitate or inhibit** the growth of following plants.


###### A plant legacy : direct and indirect pathway

Direct : root activity (rhizosphere)
Indirect : litter quantity and quality
![[Pasted image 20241011112205.png|center|200]]

- Plants modulate soil properties 
	- Soil structure
	- Soil chemistry
- Plants modify soil biological communities

• In turn, soil after conditioning by the causal plant alter plant performances (+/-)
• **PLANT SOIL FEEDBACK**
###### Duration of the legacy
- Depends on the nature of the change in soil conditions
- Depends on plant traits

###### Length of the legacy
**PSFs is also known for crop scientists when designing rotation rules** 
- So why so much articles on PSFs in agricultural lands?
- Why PSF renew our vision of managing and designing crop diversification ?
###### A plant legacy : direct & indirect pathway

- Reduce synthetic inputs if positive PSFs (agroecology)
- effects of climate change and soil functioning mediated by PSFs
- invasive species, weeds in agriculture

## II] Pathways of PSFs
### Indirect pathway of the PSFs

###### A set of retroactions are involved
![[Pasted image 20241011113538.png|center|250]]
### Two pathways of the PSFs
###### Indirectly : soil **physical** modifications

- light penetration of mechanical barriers
![[Pasted image 20241011113819.png|center|600]]
- retention of soil moisture underneath leaf litter layer
![[Pasted image 20241011114347.png|center|600]]
Mix of low and high quality litter can be used to retain moisture

>[!element] Key message
>Physical pathways have received little attention in research on litter-mediated PSFs, but it has long been known that plant litter has strong effects on the physical soil environment, both in natural and agricultural ecosystems, i.e., via crop residues.
>The effects of plant litter on the physical soil environment have strong potential to feed back to plant performance through effects on seed germination, seedling establishment, and initial plant growth

###### Indirectly : soil **chemical** properties



- During decomposition a wide range of chemical compounds is released from plant litter which can be beneficial or detrimental to subsequent generations of plants
![[Pasted image 20241011114910.png|center|650]]


- Depletion of soil nutrients (+/-)
	- Soil nutrients can be made available through rapid decomposition of nutrient-rich litter
- Modification of soil pH (+/-)
![[Pasted image 20241011115042.png|center|450]]

- Polyphenols or secondary metabolites
![[Pasted image 20241011115114.png|center|300]]




###### Indirectly : soil biological properties

- Build-up of beneficial organismes or soil-born
- Beneficial organisms (+/-)
![[Pasted image 20241011115305.png|center|250]]

###### Home Field Advantage : a specific case

The **home field advantage hypothesis (HFA)** predicts that soil decomposers are specialized to break down litter from plants in their immediate vicinity relative to that from elsewhere. The HFA hypothesis predicts faster decomposition of plant residues in *home* soil compared to soils with different plants (*away*), and hase been demonstrated in forest and grassland ecosystems
![[Pasted image 20241011115339.png|center|350]]
It remains unclear if this legacy effect applies to crop residue decomposition in arable crop rotations

###### Rhizosphere pathway

Benzoxazinoid release by maize roots is associated with change in root-associated microbiota

## III] Plant traits and PSF

##### Plants strategies and plant traits explained the PSF

Grime (1977) proposed the competitor/stress tolerator/ruderal (C-S-R) framework to explain how plants with different traits adapt under different environments.
Wright et al. (2004) built upon this concept, suggesting that plants can be globally classified along a spectrum from those that are fast-growing and promote fast nutrient cycling, to those that grow more slowly and promote slower nutrient cycling, known as the “leaf economics spectrum”.

##### Plants traits and PSFs pathways

![[Pasted image 20241011115832.png|center|300]]
- Plants possess characteristics, or trait values at tissue-to-organismal scales that reflect their evolutionary history and mould their performance and their adaptative strategies 
- Traits are central to coordinated trade-offs between
	- resource acquisition (i.e. productivity)
	- resource conservation (i.e. persistence

##### A plant legacy: fast- versus slow-growing plants

- Fast-growing plants have traits that allow them to exploit resources more quickly (rapid growth), typically high nutrient concentration
- Slow-growing plants are more conservative in their resource acquisition, grow more slowly, have lower tissue nutrient concentrations and better chemical and structural tissue defences

Plants from the same functional group have similar effects and responses to ecosystem processes and environmental conditions

## IV] Metrics of PSFs

##### Metrics in a nutshell

Plant–soil feedback research is founded on two concepts:
(i) plants cause species-specific changes to soils
(ii) Plants demonstrate species-specific responses to these changes
![[Pasted image 20241011120021.png|350]]

 - 1. conditionning, 2. Feedback

![[Pasted image 20241011125820.png|center|600]]

- PSF index = (Biomass1 – Biomass2)/Biomass 2
<i>*Biomass of root, shoot or total bi</i>
![[Pasted image 20241011125955.png|center|400]]

## V] Bridging PSF to agriculture

##### Bridging nature to agriculture via PSFs
![[Pasted image 20241011130106.png|center|600]]

##### New crop rotation rules to maximize agricultural yields ?

- Repeated planting of the same crop (monocropping) can result in reduced crop yields because of pathogen accumulation, nutrient depletion, and  autotoxication
- Developing systematic methods to manage crop rotations effectively is paramount
- PSF has the potential to serve as a valuable tool in the process to determine the most favorable crop rotation sequences
- Trait syndrome of breeding
![[Pasted image 20241011130616.png|center]]
![[Pasted image 20241011130643.png|center|400]]

- Application of plant–soil feedbacks in the selection of crop rotation sequences
- one of the first studies attempting to apply knowledge of PSF, which has been mostly confined to the field of community ecology, to the selection of crop rotation sequences.
- Transdisciplinarity : agronomy
![[Pasted image 20241011130804.png|center|350]]

## VI] PSF and climate change

>[!element] Key message
Extreme climate events, including flooding and prolonged drought, may establish long-lasting (legacy) effects on soil abiotic and biotic properties, potentially influencing soil N-cycling, microbial communities, and plant productivity.
>
>Soils face various environmental and anthropogenic pressures that alter their functional capacity to fulfil multiple ecosystem services, such as the biogeochemical cycling of elements and supporting crop productivity. To maintain these crucial functions, it is important to understand how soils respond to environmental changes or disturbance

## CONCLUSION

- The term plant-soil feedback thus encases a large variety of soil property changes
- Combining insights from research in agricultural and natural systems has potential to considerably improve our understanding of both systems
- Research on PSF has gained attention in agriculture and in natural systems in the past 10 years
- Opportunity is ripe to integrate knowledge across the systems for improved food provision and ecosystem outcomes
