## I] Theory of soil pH

#### 1) Why is soil pH so important ?

- Nutrients become more or less available based on the chemistry of the soi
- also affects the biological activity of soils (pH<sub>min</sub>,pH<sub>opt</sub>,pH<sub>max</sub>)

#### 2) Proton budget theory

#### 3) Soil buffer capacity & cation exchange capacity

<center><b>pH change = (moles H<sup><b>+</b></sup> added.ha<sup><b>-1</b></sup>)(pHBC x W)</b></center>

pHBC = pH buffer capacity (mol H<sup>+</sup> .kg<sup>-1</sup> . ph unit <sup>-1</sup>)
W = weight of component (kg.ha<sup>-1</sup>)

##### The soil microbial-mediated transformation of these elements involves numerous biogeochemical processes.

- Enzymes are footprint of biological activities
 Intra and extracellular enzymes
- **Direct or indirect pH effects.**

▪ Ionization or protonation of the acidic or basic groups in the enzyme active center is believed to account for most of the decline in enzyme activity when pH deviates from optimum
▪ Soil pH can change the concentration of inhibitors or activators, as well as the substrate in soil. Stability of soil enzymes to pH change is also highly dependent on soil properties
**▪ Changes in number and relative composition of soil microbes**

>[!element] Key messages
>- Soil itself is a buffer system for external H + input. When H + input exceeds the maximum of soil buffer capacity, it will cause soil acidification.
>- Soil acidification is a continuous and ongoing process in both natural and managed systems. All soils have buffering systems to resist acidification, which depends on intrinsic properties, such as parent material, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil texture, and minerology
>- The soil pH generally maintains a relatively stable state in response to external disturbances due to its buffering capacity (e.g., excess ions can be adsorbed by minerals or organic compounds).
>- pH is a master variable controlling soil functioning
>- Studies have been conducted to observe the correlations between diverse soil properties and soil biological activities, but correlation is not causation
>- Causal relationship between pH and soil biological activity is rarely studied.
>- Soil is a complex ecosystem; reactions in soil are different from those in a simplified chemical solution.

## III] Effect of climat change on soil pH

##### Variable and changing climate will influence soil properties, including pH as a master variables
![[Pasted image 20241011134336.png|center|550]]
• Increased biomass production in managed ecosystem due to increased temperature and/or increased rainfall is likely to result in increased acidification of soil due to removal of alkalinity in the harvested produce.
• Increased leaching of cations due to increased rainfall will transfer alkalinity from the soil exchange complex into surface waters and groundwater, leaving acidified soils.

##### Bounce effects between pH, soil biological activity and climate

![[Pasted image 20241011134448.png|center|500]]
>[!element] Key messages
>- Soil pH is a critical factor in sustaining species growth and survival on Earth, yet with ongoing climate warming, it is difficult to predict the soil pH changes due to the complexity of soil systems.
>- Soil microbiota are highly correlated with soil pH and quickly respond to climate warming, bridging climates and soil systems

##### The positive effect of soil biodiversity on multifunctionality was maintained after accounting for key ecosystem factors such as geographic location, climate (temperature and aridity), plant attributes (perennial or annual) and soil factors (pH, soil C, Clay)

• Strong but slow

**Relative to acid-base reactions in solutions and exchange reactions mineral weathering is relatively slow**

##### Element reactions- proton budgets
![[Pasted image 20241011134815.png|center|300]]
##### Soil pH is a time evolving process

1) First step of acidification : a soil pH decrease is observed but the saturation base is not affected. Acidity is neutralized
2) pH et and saturation base are decreasing: buffering processes are not efficient, nutritive cations are replaced by protons of exchange sites in soils
3) Soil acidification will increase rapidly
![[Pasted image 20241011135017.png|center|220]]
Observed pH acidification is observed when buffering processes are not efficient
