### Introduction

- Global food security entails fertile soils capable of providing food for a growing population
	- 95% of human food comes  from the soil
	- Soils are the foundation of agriculture and important in the *EU Farm to Fork* strategy
- Sustainable management of soils must combine food security, environmental protection and long-term soil conservation (soil as a non-renewable resource) : "soil for out generation but also for the next"

### 1] Evolution of concepts 

#### The soil fertility concept

- " l'aptitude d'un sol à fournir des récoltes plus ou moins abondantes" A. Demolon 1937
- Two types of fertility :
	- "**natural**" fertility : intrinsic properties
	- "**acquired**" fertility : man-made

>[!example] A fertile soil?

>
No in general due to constraint of waterlogging.
But : Yes for vineyard production
>
The soil fertility concept is ==**context dependent**== :
>- Climate, topography
>- Production system dependent


- " capacity of a soil to provide crops with essential plant nutrients " Merriam-Webster 2017
- " the ability of a soil to provide nutrients in adequate amounts and in proper balance for the growth of specified plants or crops" Glossary of the soil science society of america, 2017

### Towards more integrative approaches 

#### The multi-functional role of the soils

The proposal for an European soil thematic strategy (1990-2014)
>[!quote] "ensure a sustainable use of soils and protect their functions in a comprehensive manner in a context of increasing pressure and degradation of soils in Europe"

#### Soil functions (Blum, 1993)

- Source of raw material and water
- Platform for man-made structures
- Food and other biomass production
- Environmental interactions : storage, filtering....
- Biological habitat and gene pool
- Physical and cultural heritage

Schematic illustration of the different functions of soils according to Blum's (1988) classification (Baveye et al., 2014)

### The soil quality concept

>[!quote] "the capacity of a specific kind of soil to function, within natural or managed ecosystem boundaries, to sustain plant and animal productivity, maintain or enhance water and air quality and support human health and habitation" (Karlen et al 1997)

### The soil health concept

>[!quote] "the capacity of soil to function <u>as a vital living system</u> to sustain plant and animal productivity, maintain or enhance water and air quality, maintain or enhance water and air quality, and promote plant and animal health" (Doran & Zeiss 1997)

The capacity of soil to function sustainably as a living system (FAO 2007)

### The soil health concept is now prevailing 

![[Pasted image 20241015112109.png|center|450]]

>[!quote] "the physical, chemical and biological state of the soil which determines its capacity to function as an essential living system and to provide ecosystem services". Draft European directive, article 3, 2023

### Assessing the health status of soils in Europe in 2020

| Indicators                                              | Estimated % of "non-healthy soil" areas |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Excess nutrients (N, P)                                 | 27 - 31% <br>                           |
| Organic carbon stock (< 1% or decreasing)               | 23 %                                    |
| Peatland soils (degradation)                            | 4,8 %<br>                               |
| Soil erosion (> 2 t / ha)                               | 30 %<br>                                |
| Compaction (deep horizons)                              | 23-33%<br>                              |
| Pollution (pesticides, metals, acidification, etc.)<br> | 40-80 %<br>                             |
| Soil sealing                                            | 1-3 %<br>                               |
| Salinisation                                            | 2 %<br>                                 |
| Desertification Growing <br>                            | (east, south)                           |
| Soil biodiversity                                       | No data                                 |
==In the end: 60-70% of European soil estimated to be "unhealthy" by 2020 (source: JRC, 2020)==

### Discussion

• Soil quality/health as an enlargement of the initial soil fertility concept: more functions, not only cultivated soils
• A given soil has simultaneously several functions 
• A cultivated soil has not only a function of production (fertility), but also other functions e.g. environmental regulation and biodiversity habitat

◼ A concept developed by soil scientists, agronomists and lawyers

### Development of the ecosystem services framework

- Attempts from the 1950’s of US ecological economists to give value to nature
- Philosophy of « market-related » mechanisms to better manage environmental issues
- " Costanza et al. 1997 : « The value of the world’s ecosystem services and natural capital »

>[!quote] =>The services of ecological systems and the natural capital stocks that produce them are critical to the functioning of the Earth's life support system. They contribute to human welfare, both directly and indirectly and therefore represent part of the total economic value of the planet. We have estimated the current value of 17 ecosystem services" 

### Average annual global value of ecosystem services (Costanza et al., 1997)

| Climate regulation                       | 684                                 |

### Comparison of the value of natural versus agricultural ecosystems
![[Pasted image 20241015114327.png|center|450]]

### Definitions of the key terms

- Ecosystem services: « benefits people obtain from ecosystems »
- Natural capital : « stocks of natural assets (e.g. soils, forests, water bodies) that yield a flow of valuable ecosystem goods or services”.

### Ecosystem versus environmental services ?

![[Pasted image 20241015114526.png|center|350]]

### Focus: Ecosystem Services - The benefits people obtain from ecosystem
![[Pasted image 20241015114646.png|center|350]]

### Focus: Consequences of Ecosystem Change for Human Well-being
![[Pasted image 20241015114751.png|center|550]]

### Adaptation of the concepts to the soil
![[Pasted image 20241015114905.png|center|550]]
### Linking the function/services approaches

- Soil Quality (JRC, 2007)
- " Soil quality is an account of the soil’s ability to provide ecosystem services through its capacities to perform its functions under changing conditions"

### Conclusion
– Soil ecosystem services and natural capital: a concept not fully mature
– Interests: why agronomists should embrace an Ecosystems Approach ?(Robinson et al., 2012)
- (i) Integrative nature of the concept
- (ii) recognition of soil as a natural resource 
- (iii) recognition of the importance of soil for human well-being (iv) links and synergies between disciplines
– Challenges:
- Standardised definition of the services
- Proper quantification of the services including uncertainties
- Alternatives to monetary valuation
