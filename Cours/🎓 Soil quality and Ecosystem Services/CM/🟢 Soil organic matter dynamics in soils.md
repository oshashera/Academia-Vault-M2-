## Context, objectives and organization

##### The decrease of soil organic matter
![[Pasted image 20241008141959.png]]
##### The key role of soil organic matter in living soils 
![[Pasted image 20241008142028.png|center]]

##### SOM relationship with other soil properties

![[Pasted image 20241008142109.png|center|400]]

Aggregate stability is an indicator of the aggregate strength to physical stresses (rain, wind).

The challenge is more about stopping the decrease of the SOM content and as a consequence the decrease of erosion risk.

## I] Biotransformations and stabilisation

#### Biodegradation / mineralization / stabilisation
Carbon and nitrogen cycles : Four main processes : **decomposition, stabilization, mineralization, organizatio**n

#### Mineralization / organization
![[Pasted image 20241008142607.png|center|550]]
#### Stabilization mechanisms

#### Chemical characterization / carbon stabilization

> [!element] Contents Complex molecules :
>•non soluble in water
>•linked to cations
>•Associated to soil minerals
>•The extraction could simulates the accessibility of the organic molecules

>[!element] Extraction must not:
•Modify the molecule
•complete
•Adapted to a large range of soils

>[!element] Analysis
Quantity and quality (HPLC, NMR, GC…)

#### Emerging question : Persistence of lignin in soils

MRT Lignin < MRT TOC
-> its contribution to soil organic carbon stabilization is not the only one process !

#### Sugars as markers of degradation and stabilization

#### Physical stabilization dynamic

![[Pasted image 20241008150816.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241008150958.png]]
>[!element] Physical stabilization dynamic Interrelationship between the turnover of macroaggregates, the turnover of SOM and controlling factors such as disturbance (i.e. tillage). Turnover occurs through time as an aggregate is formed, becomes unstable and is eventually disrupted. Disturbances such as tillage shortcut this “life cycle” of macroaggregates and diminish the formation rate of new microaggregates

**Tillage modifies the « turnover » of the aggregates**

#### Physical fractionation

#### Isotopic methods : natural abundance of <sup>13</sup>C

#### Spatial organization in soil
![[Pasted image 20241008151353.png]]
>[!element] Organic matter accessibity and variability of environmental conditions in the soil :
• Acid to basic
• Wet to dry
• Aerobic to anaerobic
• Oxydized to reduced
• Nutrient poor to nutrient rich

#### Stabilization mechanisms : case of root contribution

#### Architecture and rooting profile

#### Priming effect

>[!element] • PE has been defined as a change in the mineralization rate of SOM as a response to some FOM addition (Jenkinson, 1966).

>[!element] • SOM can be under-mineralized, in which case the PE is said to be negative, or over-mineralized, with a resulting positive PE

![[Pasted image 20241008151729.png]]
>[!element] • Hypothesis have been proposed, including cometabolism, competition or mutualism between various microbial communities

>[!element] • It depends on FOM input (regular inputs), carbon quality, nitrogen availability

>[!element] • For example, it was demonstrated that plants through their exudates not only provide energy to soil microorganisms but also seem to control the way the energy is used in order to maximize soil organic matter mineralization and drive their own nutrient supply.

##### Conclusions

OM accumulation depends on
- Clay content, carbonates content
- Soil biological activity and diversity
- Organic input biochemical characteristics
- $ **Pedo-climatic conditions x Agricultural practice combinations**

Simulation of its dynamic is still a challenge
