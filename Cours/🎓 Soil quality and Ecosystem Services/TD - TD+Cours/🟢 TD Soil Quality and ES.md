## Introduction

#### 1. What is the scope of the article written by Salomé et al. (2014) ?

Evaluation of soil quality in mediterranean region (in vineyards)
contribution of inherent soil properties to dynamic soil quality
=> classification of soils based on those relationships in terroir contexts for winegrower to use

Wine = perenial + mediterannean area

Origin of the question ? 

Theats : 
-intense practices => no lever to improve soil quality by crop rotation (inherent problem to perenial crops), sometimes in wineyard, every two weeks, fungicide application (average), thus soil compaction, pollution due to pesticide/fungicide,etc.... and fertilisation + organic matter amendment aren't important because of low need of nitrogen. Don't want too much nitrogen, can make lots of leaves if so, thus less sugar, more humidity thus more fungi,...
Usually, SOM is low in wineyard, even moreso in mediterranean context.
Slow decomposition if not enough rain
Water competition important, bare soil often thus erosion.
Pollution : copper applicaton every two weeks conjointly with fungicide

Wine production is very specific, because of the concept of terroir => specific combination of Soil X Climate X Plant X Human + has touristic value and aesthetic contribution.
Soil will contribute to the terroir and will interfere with the final production and will have to be taken into account.

We have to assess the soil quality 
Have to involve the target users

#### 2. How do authors define soil quality ?

“Soil quality is defined as the **ability of soil to function as a vital living system** and to **deliver ecosystem services** related to plant and animal *production, regulation of nutrient cycles and pollution and conservation of biodiversity*” (Salome et al., 2014, p. 84) Leur définition

We have to ask the target users (farmers) what is soil quality for them to include them, while keeping the definition above for soil science.

Soil quality is related to end users, others think it is related to searchers
#### 3. List the inherent and dynamic indicators of soil quality. Do you think some dynamic indicators could have been considered as inherent ones ?

>[!tldr] Inherent indicators
>The former is intimately linked to pedogenetic processes; it is almost invariant at the human scale and can be used for land-use planning

>[!tldr] Dynamic indicators
> Dynamic soil quality is influenced by land use, agricultural practices, soil management and climate change and is consequently likely to vary over a short time period, especially for the topsoil, i.e. the upper soil layer (0–15 to 0–30 cm)

>[!tldr] SELECTED Inherent and Dynamic components/ indicators

>![[Pasted image 20241009151247.png|600]]

Soil water capacity and soil depth could have been deemed as inherent as it is slow to change and isn't only comprised on the 0-30 layer
They weren't selected because they are harder to measure/estimate or costly

Cu = copper availability



#### 4. Why are biological indicators used in this article ? Can you define a biological indicators ?

Increased sensitivity to environmental changes, thus providing a broader picture of the soil quality.
Soft traits mainly, relating to the organisms.

- Biological biomass : respiration , ratios etc.... respiration is a proxy for biomass etc (if low = bad)
But it is cheap as a biological indicator
- Nematods
Used cuz easy and cheap to collect, and abundance X morphology (guilds) is a good indicator.

164 fields sampled

## Results

#### 5. Why is regionalization lost when some indicators are added in the statistical analysis ?

Statistical noise because more indicators
Inherent ones are more related to site

![[Pasted image 20241009152251.png]]
6 different group of soils

#### 6. How can a referential be used to adapt vineyard practices per soil type or terroir ?

soils in X


## Perspectives 

#### 7. From the initial functional classification of soil, authors reduced number of soils to 3 soils type to evaluate management practices. Comment the sensitivity of indicators to practices.

Biological ones are more sensitive to detect small changes, so they are better, especially nematodes (more relevant)
Some indicators can be used in certain groups only.
