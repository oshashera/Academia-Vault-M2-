### P (and K) fertilization decision tool

- Nitrate pollution has dominated the debate between fertilization and environmental protection
- P is involved in eutrophication AND is a non renewable resource
- Its management requires a field approach based on P biogeochemical cycle (organic + mineral forms)

- In France: a three step approach as in many countries
- In a nutshell : based on soil P status (soil analysis) and plant P requirements, <u>but</u>
	- the soil P analysis can differ between soil types
	- in France, **P exportation** and **P demand(requirement)** is used 

### Prerequisites for calculations
I am able to identify inputs and outputs from field
I am able to explain why P is seen as a continuum or pools
I am able to draw a schematic scheme of P cycle 

In this practical we'll discover the COMIFER method
### - You will need to obtain information : 

![[Pasted image 20241009091142.png]]
Some crops will need precise P inputs, other can face a deficit.
Qualitative information based on experimental data
![[Pasted image 20241009091311.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241009091430.png]]
All the plant have different sensitivity to P deficiency.
To quantify the need of phosphorus needed we'll habe to estimate using yield objectives
## - Obtain the trade off !!!!
![[Pasted image 20241009092441.png]]
P ferti = Coef X Yield X P exported by plant organs harvested

### - Different sources of informations combined into a single equation
![[Pasted image 20241009092719.png]]

### - Soil P test
![[Pasted image 20241009092813.png]]
Blue dots = experimental points
If ratio is 1 => P availability is enough
For small P amount, low yield
If increase => stagnation of indice => enough P in soil for the crop
Exp point used to fit statistical models.
You can have a decrease of 10% of the yield if you decrease the soil p status
Crit P value is red arrow = 10% reduction compared to max
Green, if more important than the green apex => decrease
![[Pasted image 20241009092853.png]]
If below, not add P
Between => check if good

### - Plant (HIGH Vs Low requirements)

### Crop residue management

**Defined in 90’s, under revision to precise the local references**
If the initial principles do not change, the calculation grids are updated with new knowledge (table of contents in exports) and improved, as in the case of taking into account straw exports.

### - Obtain the trade off !!!!
![[Pasted image 20241009092441.png]]
We can now determine the coeff from the comifer doc

### - Let’s have a look on a COMIFER repository

## TD TD ?

Take document PDF on moodle and answer to the question

If you don’t haven’t the following answer, try again and read carefully the table and this video. 
Otherwise, meet us  !!! (refer to your celcat schedule) 


Farmer will add 63 kg P in this field 
23 (0 kg P in the second  field P if Trenf x2)

##### **1. Calculation of the P requirement**

Case study 1. **YEAR 2021**

- You have a loamy soil, pHwater is 6,5 in Brittany
- You have a soil analysis (table 1), Polsen : 35 mg Kg-1 P2O5 : ==> 0.44 x 35 = 15.40
- In 2020, you did not fertilize with P, but in 2019 you add some P
- This year, you planify to produce rapeseed (_Brassica napus_) (HIGH requirement crop) at 35q/ha. Quintal is a French unit = 100 kg or 0,1 metric ton

![[Pasted image 20241009095617.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241009095635.png]]

**30,9737** **P**
**15,9994 O**

30.9738 x 2 + 15.9994 x 5 = 141.94 g/mol
30.9738 x 2 = 61.95
61.95/141.94 = 0.44 => 0.44 g P / g P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>

##### 1. Determine the multiplicative coefficient based on the different grids (table 1 and table 2)

##### 1.1 Determine the critical P values

On a 35 (énoncé) => 35 x 0.44 = 15.40 mg P

Et les besoins sont entre
50 (cf tableau 2) ==> 50x0.44 = 22 mg P
et
80 (cf tableau 2) ==> 80x0.44 = 35.20 mg P

 ==> C la sauce
![[Drawing 2024-10-09 10.15.26.excalidraw]]
##### 1.2 Draw a scheme to replace your soil analysis, and the two critical P values
![[Drawing 2024-10-09 10.18.51.excalidraw]]



###### 1.3 Determine the multiplicative coefficient

Tableau 1
On a pas ferti pendant 1 an ==> 3.3


##### 2.Determine total exportations. Brassica napus needs 1,25 kg/q of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>

35 q/ha en besoin
1,25 kg/q P2O5
q/ha x kg / q  => kg/ha  ==> 1.25 x 35 = 43.75 kg/ha P205 =>

##### 3. What is the total amount of P (Kg) you will have to purchase to meet your yield objective ?

3.3 x 43.75 = 144.38 => besoin en P205 kg/ha => 1.44 q/ha P2O5
144.38 x 0.44 = 63.53 q/ha P à ajouter

##### 4. The farmer have decided to produce the same crop in another field. The amount of P olsen **is 87 mg.Kg**<sup>-1</sup>, how many P the farmer will purchase ?

On a 85 (énoncé) =>  85 x 0.44 = 37.40  mg P

Et les besoins sont entre
50 (cf tableau 2) ==> 50x0.44 = 22 mg P
et
80 (cf tableau 2) ==> 80x0.44 = 35.20 mg P

On est approximativement à Timp+10% (cf tableau 1), avec 1 an sans ferti et high en besoin => coeff 1.2
Les exportations restent les mêmes : 43.75
=> besoin P = 43.75 x 1.2 = 52.50 kg/ha P205
52.5 x 0.44 = 23.10 kg/ha P
