### Brainsorming

Question adressed to sudents : 
How can you assess soil quality 
Wich indicators => physical, chemical, bilogical
How can you manage the data => compare to references all the time


##### Are organic matter application relevant [diapo]



After 15y application
near paris (qualiagro) => no diff, all of them are better than control and control + N => increase in microbial biomass
In colmar, only the MSW is différent (significatively) than the others (cuz A and others are AB <=> B for control)

Why ? => different timing of the biological response, (vitesse de relachement dans la biosphère des nutriments)

composting reduces the risk of pathogens
