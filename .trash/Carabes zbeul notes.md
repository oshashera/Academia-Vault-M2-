|M√™me ==**grani**== incorporent larves ? => **tous carni** m√™me un tt petit peu ?|None of these studies found a benefit of mixing insect food with the seeds. However, several species of _Harpalus_ and _Amara_ include animal food in their diet both in the laboratory and in the field||
||**Slugs and earthworms** are other animal prey on which some carabids have specialized.||
|==**granivores**== mangent aussi slugs ?|the **slug remains were found in a higher percent of individuals of the granivorous species** _A. similata_ than of generalist carnivorous species as e.g. _P. melanarius_, which has been reported as a slug predator||
||The range of food types tested was chosen to cover those on which some carabid groups have specialized, i.e. **insects, earthworms, molluscs (slugs and snails), and seeds** were used as a control diet||
||Earthworms are one of the most abundant types of soil invertebrates in Europe, and **several carabid species have been reported to eat earthworms**||

|**Grani : seeds > +slug > + grasshoper (insect) > + earthworm**|Survival (%) was highest on the pure seed diet and the mixed seed + slug diet, followed by the mixed seed + grasshopper and seed + earthworm diets||

|=> et la diff entre seed et  <br>grasshoppers pas si marqu√©e  <br>puisque due √† autres effets|The difference between the seed and the grasshopper group was mainly due to pre-ingestive effects||
||The insect diets were slightly better than other pure animal diets because some larvae from these groups survived to the second instar, but they could not develop further than that. Seeds were high-quality food for the larvae.||
||Similar findings have been reported previously||
||[...] found better survival and faster development in _A. aenea_ on a mixed seed-insect diet||
|L'int√©r√™t apparait que plus tard dans stade de dev|Adding grasshoppers or earthworms to the seed diet had a negative effect on larval survival. However, both had a positive effect on pupal and teneral weights. This might both increase their chances of survival and mating and their fecundity. [...] weight prior to pupation may have a great impact on adult fitness||
|On s'en fiche en conditions r√©elles ou pas ? genre ils choisissent nn ?|the presence of a low-quality food in a mixed diet might prevent the consumer from gaining a benefit from a high-quality constituent of the mixed diet||
|Grani peuvent (ancestral) compl√©menter par carni ?|A. similata is not a fully specialized species on seeds, but may to some extent supplement its diet with animal food resources||
|üò≠üò≠|It can be characterized as an omnivore with granivory as the main feeding habit and carnivory as a supplementary feeding habit||
|Mangent insectes (carab test = 2 carni 1 omni) des Cicadellidae, Thysanoptera et Aphidae|Most European carabid beetles and wolf spiders are predominantly epigeal, while the herbivorous Cicadellidae, Thysanoptera and Aphididae live on plants. Gut dissections and field observations, however, have shown that Carabidae and Lycosidae prey upon all these insect taxa in the field|Lang 1999|
|Impact sp et saison en + de disponibilit√© ?|In addition to varying food availability, the effects of species identity and season on carabid food choice should also be closely examined|Guenay-Greunke 2024|
|Plante, pu√ßerons,|the gut contents of 1,120 beetles of eight carabid species were screened for the DNA of **plants, aphids, springtails, earthworms and slugs**||
||Diet choice was found to be influenced by carabid species and time, but not on seed availability||
||Carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) provide ecosystem services such as **weed seed predation**||
|Granivore => euhh c'est sp √† sp apparemment donc aie|Preference experiments have shown that **carabid body mass and species identity** as well as **seed size** all **influence seed selection**||
|Effet taille seed (dans quel sens ?)|weed seed traits, such as **seed size**, can affect feeding behaviour and hence food choice of carabids||
|Masse et contenu en lipide (‚Üë je pr√©sume ?)|besides **seed mass**, **lipid content** can also play a major role in the weed seed consumption by carabids (Gaba et al. 2019).||
|questionnement ? que choisir ?|to what extent weed seed and pest regulation services may be in competition with each other, e.g. through the food choice of omnivorous carabid species||
||Agonum muelleri / Bembidion tetracolum / Clivina fossor / Carabus granulatus / Pterostichus anthracinus / Poecilus cupreus / Pterostichus melanarius / Pseudoophonus rufipes||
|Plante > vdt > collembole > pucerons > mollusque|In the diagnostic PCR screening for the differentiation of animal food and consumed seeds, 72% of all detections were **plant** DNA, followed by 12.5% **lumbricid** DNA, 8.3% **collembolan** DNA and 2.0% for the **cereal aphids** (0.9% R. padi, 0.6% M. dirhodum, and 0.5% S. avenae) as well as 4.1% for **slugs** (1.6% Limacoidea, 1.4% Arionidae, 1.1% A. lusitanicus, and 0.8% D. reticulatum)||
|Pr√©valence √©norme (dans liste sp) des graines vs les 17% max des lombriciens|The food choices of the different carabid species in terms of the ratio between animal food and consumed seeds were similar for all of them (Fig. S1): plant detection rates were much higher than those of animal prey, ranging between 65 and 84%, with the exception of C. granulatus having a clearly lower percentage (47%). Compared to these high plant detection rates, the next highest value for animal prey was only at 17% for lumbricids when looking at the beetle species C. granulatus or P. cupreus||
|ok c la mierdaaaaa  <br>on va faire des assumptions  <br>hein|In addition, a strong impact of carabid species identity on food choice rather than the varying availability of slugs and weed seeds became apparent. Since carabid identity seems to play a crucial role in slug and seed predation||
|Mangent d√©tritivores printemsp et herbi / omni invert en automne|Detritivores comprised the main diets of abundant harpaline species in the spring, whereas abundant harpaline species in the autumn were primarily herbivores feeding on C4 plants, or omnivores feeding on herbivorous invertebrates and C3 plants.|Ikeda 2010|
|C la mierde le retour, d√©finitivement faire des assumptions|Overall, harpaline beetles in this grassland used a wide range of food items, which was demonstrated by the large variation in stable isotope ratios among species. In addition, the composition of food was largely differentiated among species||
|Poids inf √† 3mg|"Seeds that exceeded 3 mg in weight (i.e _G. aparine_ and _V.hederifolia_) were rarely consumed in the laboratory and the field"|Petit 2014|
|**Lipid rich ?**|"strong preferences of carabids for particular species, in our case the seed of _V. arvensis_, while that of _C. bursa-pastoris_ was neither preferred or avoided. this might be explained by differences in the energy content of weed seeds (both _C. bursa-pastoris_ and _V. arvensis_ have **lipid-rich seeds**)"||
|**Epaisseur duret√© t√©gument ?**|"and also by differences in the **thickness and hardness of the seed coat** of individual species [...] a seed attribute that is poorly documented in literrature"||
|Taille|The seed dimensions explaining over 13% of the preferences was the main factor affecting seed selection [6,33,34], even when other properties are considered|Foffova 2020|
|T√©gument|The properties of the seed coat were also important because the seed coat protects seeds against predators. To open seeds, many species of carabids have evolved broad mandibles with large adductors [69] and bases that are generally triangular||
||Species of the tribe **Zabrini** have short, square-shaped mandibles that are blunt at the tips, and are more adapted for **crushing hard seeds**. This can explain why the **seed coat properties** were important properties for seed preference by **Harpalini** (13% of explained variance) but less so for **Zabrini** (5% of explained variance)||
||for the tribe Harpalini, seed properties related to their taxonomy did not appear to be a significant determinant of preferences [...] Harpalini are less specialised than Zabrini||
|Pas facile de pr√©dire vu que sp√©cifique √† l'esp√®ce ?|seed traits to which the carabid **seed predators respond** may be speciesor higher taxon-specific and perhaps **dependent** on the **degree of carabid specialisation for seeds**.||
||**Zabrini** species are more **specialised**, to a narrower range of seeds, often with the **same ecology** or from the same family||
||**Harpalini** species (Figure 1b) are more **generalists**; therefore, it is ecologically sound that **seed mass and dimensions** would be the major variable||
||**Seed** **chemistry** did **not** seem to play a crucial role||
|Mon probl√®me oui üòî|Various authors use different classifications of carabids according to their diet|Saska, 2019|
||Also, species **not belonging to the tribes Harpalini or Zabrini** tended to eat **seeds** of the offered species only **reluctantly** (Table 3)||
||Also, particular seed species differed in their attractiveness for carabid beetles as the frequency of being preferred largely varied among the species of seeds||
||groups that are generally **regarded as granivorous or at least in which seeds constitute an important part** of their diet (**Zabrini** and **Harpalini**)||
||On the contrary, middle-sized species are able to utilize not only the species of seeds intermediate in size but also small and larger ones, which has resulted in overall higher consumption and lower specificity for species of seeds ‚Üì(partie)||

|Traduire ca en traits de plantes ? genre trait sp√©cifique (ou pas) familles ?|But, some affinities to seeds can be observed at the level of carabid tribes, such as that several Harpalini exclusively preferred both species of Amaranthaceae and L. cardiaca. In Zabrini, some differences can also be observed among spring and autumn reproducing species. Besides a pool of species commonly preferred at the genus level, the autumn reproducing species Amara preferred seeds of C. intybus and C. arvense, while the spring breeding species preferred seeds of Brassicaceae||

|Moins effet des grasslands / herbac√©es ?|Generally, habitats with herbaceous vegetation, and particularly grasslands, have a less important role (Morris et al. 2010). However, grasslands on field margins have been poorly investigated in terms of insects and other arthropods,||
|Mais positif "iles semi-naturelles" dans paysages agricoles pour carabe, parasito et polli|Different authors have indicated the positive effect of these environmental islands on the abundance of hoverflies, carabids, parasitoids and pollinators in agroecosystems||

|**les buissons et les habitats arbustifs, la for√™t et les foss√©s**|This proves the strong biological potential of field margin habitats, especially **bushes/shrubby habitats, the forest and ditches**, which could be the main ecological corridors, promoting the dispersal of useful Carabidae (SÃåustek 1994, 1998), including potentially aphidophagous species, to agroecosystems||
||the gradient between forest-like corridors and fields is most effective when the corridors consist of autochtonus trees and shrubs. Those biosystems increase the migration of up to 30% of the carabid species in a forest.||
||L. assimilis [...] as well as in the fields (PI, PII), where dense cereal plants or sugar beet leaves covered and shaded the soil.||

||suggested that the protection and reestablishment of woody semi-natural habitats is crucial for functionally diverse spider and carabid assemblages with a high proportion of predators||
||the structural type of vegetation is likely to have more effect on carabid species than plant species||
|(shelterbelts = brise-vent)  <br>Important dans migration foret‚Üíchamp = corridor avec impact largeur, densit√© et compo du corridor|SÃåustek (1994) underlined that one of the **most important factors influencing migration of forest carabids from their forest habitats into fields** are the **width, density and composition of the corridors**, and the positive effect of the **shelterbelts** was observable up to 50‚Äì200 m from their margins.||
|**for√™t et buissons** donc => lignin ?|Considering all the investigated field margin habitats, ground beetles were most numerous in the ouk-hornbeam, defined as bushes [...] Relatively numerous assemblages of carabids were also found near one of the ditches with herbaceous vegetation, adjacent to bushes, and in the distant riparian forest||
|de la variance encore pour marquer diversit√© bota?|suggests that in order for an area to be a useful reservoir of carabid beetles it needs to be as botanically diverse as possible.|Desender 1994 (livre)|
|variance a fond ?|high abundance of these beetles in a large variety of habitats||
|Limitation extr√™mes temp / humi (donc for√™t utile?) pour overwinter  <br>Pour certaines sp, hibernation dans boisement mais repro dans grassland (div / variance ?)|Habitat and microhabitat distribution can be influenced by several factors:  <br>1) **Temperature or humidity extremes** (several examples in 182). Favorite wintering sites are well aerated, and winter minimum temperatures are relatively high (58, 183).  <br>2) Food conditions. For example, exclusively spermophagous Ophonus spp. are present in open habitats where seeds of Umbelliferae are available, whereas polyphagous Harpalus spp. aggregate in crops (209). Marked Poecilus cupreus and Pterostichus melanurius moved from winter wheat to a weed strip within the wheat field (where feeding conditions were better) much more frequently than they moved the reverse direction (128).  <br>3) Presence and distribution of competitors. For example, forest carabids in Finland were influenced by the distribution of Formica ant species (141).  <br>4) Life history and season. Amara plebeja, for instance, has **different hibernation (woodland) and reproduction (grassland) habitats**. The beetles fly between habitats in spring and autumn. Flight muscles are temporarily autolysed between flights, then completely reconstructed for the return flight. In the autumn, they fly toward woodland silhouette shapes (190)|Sunderland 1996|
|Trop sp√© / diff √† l'√©chelle de l'sp ? => var ?|We know, for example, many species that are specialized to certain moisture, temperature and shadiness conditions|Koivula 2011|

|Trop sp√© / diff √† l'√©chelle de l'sp ? => var ?|The micro scale appears equally promising: carabids are physiologically extremely sensitive to sugars, salts, amino acids, pH and temperature||

|=>bordure = √©cotone = diff / ‚Üëdiversit√© √©co => var ?|Thus, the **field boundary habitats** were important for some species, either as the only habitat in which they occurred (Amara spp.), as the major focus of their more widespread distribution (H. rufipes), or as a seasonal refuge (N. brevicollis)|CFG 2001|
|Donc tirer un "habitat" type m√™me pour des cat√©gories ca reste complexe|Edaphic and physical factors (such as soil type and texture, topography, drainage pattern and aspect), together with anthropogenic factors (such as habitat distribution, crop history and management) and ecological factors (Table 1), are likely to interact in complex ways to drive the observed patterns of carabid distributions in farmland.||
|hors field => diversit√© florale + hedgerow donc **var florale + pr√©sence lignine** ?|The **predatory beetles were found mainly in the field** and, as expected, those with mixed or mainly plant diets were largely confined to the **florally diverse hedgerow**||

|Mais **arbres** important plus que edge ?|The species richness of carabids at the edge was lower than in the orchard,||
||Because the occurrence of carabids depends on environmental conditions such as **temperature, moisture, and vegetation type** (Kromp 1999; Holland 2002)||
||Carabids can be classified according to the habitat where they are observed in the agroecosystem (Fournier & Loreau 1999; French & Elliott 1999)||
|Pouvoir couvrant / sla √©quivalent ?|Therefore, the high diversity of carabids and the presence of dominant species in the orchard are due probably to no soil disturbance and the presence of **ground vegetation** on the orchard soil.||
|Grasses pour overwinter => pas lignin et hauteur faible ?|Many species of ground beetles **overwinter in grasses** growing along borders adjacent to cereal grains and disperse into the fields in the spring|French 1999|
|Var (compo = for√™t/bois + grassland + √©cotones/bordure) ?|four species were classified as **grassland species**, two as **edge species**, five as wheat field species, and five as **habitat generalists** [...] **Generalist species represent ground beetles captured consistently in all habitats**||

|**architecture racine**|Habitat selection based on **soil softness** (Giglio et al., 2003) may partly explain the higher density of individuals overwintering within fields of annual crops which are ploughed annually.||
