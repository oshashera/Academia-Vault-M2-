[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9XKIRNN?page=505&annotation=6I6N2MIX) “Negative effects of fragmentation are likely due to two main causes.”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9XKIRNN?page=505&annotation=UYNFG5BU) “First, fragmentation per se implies a larger number of smaller patches. At some point, each patch of habitat will be too small to sustain a local population or perhaps even an individual territory. Species that are unable to cross the nonhabitat portion of the landscape (the “matrix”) will be confined to a large number of too-small patches, ultimately reducing the overall population size and probability of persistence”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9XKIRNN?page=505&annotation=CJBVX99E) “The second main cause of negative effects of fragmentation per se is negative edge effects; more fragmented landscapes contain more edge for a given amount of habitat. This can increase the probability of individuals leaving the habitat and entering the matrix. Overall the amount of time spent in the matrix will be larger in a more fragmented landscape, which may increase overall mortality rate and reduce overall reproductive rate of the population (Fahrig 2002). In addition, there are negative edge effects due to species interactions. Probably the most extensively studied of these is increased predation on forest birds at forest edges”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9XKIRNN?page=506&annotation=5RQWQFIJ) “even if fragmentation per se has a positive effect on biodiversity, this effect will be masked by the large negative effect of habitat loss.”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9XKIRNN?page=506&annotation=EHVLL4WL) “coexistence of two competing species could be extended by dividing the habitat into more, smaller patches”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9XKIRNN?page=506&annotation=6FEZQ7TI) “Enhanced coexistence resulted from a trade-off between dispersal rate and competitive ability. This trade-off, along with asynchronous disturbances that locally removed the superior competitor, allowed the inferior competitor (but superior disperser) to colonize the empty patches first, before being later displaced by the superior competitor (Chesson 1985)”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9XKIRNN?page=506&annotation=X2YA2I4Y) “Other researchers suggested that habitat subdivision could even stabilize single-species population dynamics when local disturbances are asynchronous by reducing the probability of simultaneous extinction of the whole population”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9XKIRNN?page=506&annotation=SHEJF5BF) “the predicted positive effects of fragmentation per se depend strongly on particular assumptions about the relative movement rates of predator versus prey (or host versus parasite), the trade-off between competitive ability and movement rate, and the asynchrony of disturbances”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9XKIRNN?page=507&annotation=VBJ4TJF7) “For example, immature insects and amphibians often use different habitats than those they use as adults.

(1992). For the same amount of habitat, a more fragmented landscape (more, smaller patches, and more edge) will have a higher level of interdigitation of different habitat types. This should increase landscape complementation, which has a positive effect on biodiversity”
