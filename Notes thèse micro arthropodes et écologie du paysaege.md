A conceptual model that could help to resolve the fragmentation debate but has received little attention is **habitat reachability** (villard & metzer 2014)

Landscape with the same habitat amount can have different levels of reachability

#### What is the best strategy to design landscapes for biodiversity conservation ??????

The closer the resource the higher the probability of successful foraging (collembola)
High quality resources produce larger individuals who tend to forage faster
Short perception distance (1-2 cm) with a memory strategy

What did we observe ?

#### Patch colonization in different matrics is explained by mortality risk

#### Population size is explained by the amount of reachable habitat

#### Explicit incorporation of matrix resistance in habitat reachability

#### First extinction at week 6 in landscape with less reachable habitat

### Connectivity experiment

#### Corridors increase dispersal at short distances but at long distances also increase mortality
![[Pasted image 20250318150257.png]]


#### Higher colonization success in corridors

#### Higher adult survival in networks by channelizing their movement
